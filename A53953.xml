            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF there be any room for Books amidſt our common and deep ſorrows for the death of that excellent and moſt beloved Prince, the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, I am willing to hope, that this little piece may not be altogether unwelcome to the World, becauſe the ſubject
<pb facs="tcp:59160:3"/>
of it is of ſtanding and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe, eſpecially in Times when we are moſt apt to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect our ſelves, and can find no ſuch ſolid and ſubſtantial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as at Gods Altar. And ſince I have preſumed upon your leave, to prefix your great Name to this following diſcourſe, I am in all juſtice and duty bound to give your Grace an account of this undertaking.</p>
            <p>Among many great Calamities, which were the effects of the late inteſtine War, this was one, That the Holy Communion was in ſome places ſo ſparingly uſed, in ſome ſo wholly neglected, in moſt ſo little conſider'd, that we ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in danger of quite loſing a main part of Chriſtianity. The unity of the Church being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, variety of pernicious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
<pb facs="tcp:59160:3"/>
to diſparage and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it; which took ſuch Root in peoples minds, that for theſe five and twenty years laſt paſt, it hath been a matter of no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to reſtore it to its due E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Obſervation in ſome tolerable meaſure. Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies either with Papiſts or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sectaries took up the greateſt part of Mens time and pains: And tho' ſome Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion have been written upon this ſubject; yet 'twas impoſſible to conceive how this Myſtery could be reſtored to its right uſe, till Men were throughly informed of its Nature and Ends; which popular Men in the late times ſeemed to have very little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or very ſuperficially to have looked into. Therefore to ſerve the World in this particular, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have lately laboured hard;
<pb facs="tcp:59160:4"/>
but none ſeem to have done it with greater ſolidity, or better ſucceſs, then that excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Truly good Man, Dr. <hi>Symon Patrick,</hi> now Dean of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbourgh;</hi> to whom even the learned part of the World is much indebted for his pains upon this Subject; which indeed have been ſo aboundant, that to write after him may be thought to be only the doing of the ſame thing over again, which was better done before. However conſidering how ſcandalouſly great the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and miſtakes of many People are ſtill concerning this matter, and finding that the Government hath been awakened at the ſenſe of thoſe dangers which Church and State both are in by reaſon of mens ſtraglings from this weighty Ordinance; I thought it neceſſary for me, in the execution
<pb facs="tcp:59160:4"/>
of my Office to beſtow ſome conſiderable time upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Sacrament, to treat of it purpoſely, and as fully as I could, and to accommodate my ſelf to the Apprehenſions of thoſe that are of the moſt vulgar and ordinary underſtandings, by diſcourſing upon this Theme after a plain Catechetical manner. This could not well be done, but by going over the whole, and by diſcourſing firſt of the Notional or Doctrinal part: in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution whereof; as <hi>I</hi> thought it proper for me to obſerve the ſame inſtructive Method which others had taken, ſo I thought it neceſſary to look narrowly into two things eſpecially, which the the Generality of men have not throughly examined and ſearched into. Firſt to look into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and uſe thoſe Ancient Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
<pb facs="tcp:59160:5"/>
Banquets, which ſome few Writers of late have very luckily taken notice of. For, in regard that this Chriſtian Feaſt doth bear a great Reſemblance to thoſe Feaſts which all Mankind did anciently celebrate upon part of their Sacrifices, I did conceive that to give a plain and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, would be the beſt way both to open the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Feaſt, and to remove many great Errours which divers Opinionators, eſpecially the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> do entertain concerning this Myſtery; who have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and debauched the minds of of men, by thoſe mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Notions, which they have vended abroad in the World. Secondly 'twas neceſſary to look into the genuine meaning of the Real Preſence of Chriſts Body and Bloud in the Sacrament. For in
<pb facs="tcp:59160:5"/>
this point abundance of poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are at a loſs, being not able to underſtand it ſo fully and clearly as they ought. And having to do in that particular with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who are wont to cheat men into the ſin of Apoſtacy by urging thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body, and this is my Bloud;</hi> it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite for me to give ſuch a fair account of the meaning of thoſe expreſſions, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Faith of the Catholick Church, and ſerve to ſatisfie the minds of men fully and clearly. For tho enough hath been ſaidagainſt Tranſubſtantiation, and moſt people among us are convinced of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and abſurdity of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet it requires a great deal of pains to open and unfold the right Faith concerning the real preſence, ſo as to render it intelligible and clear; becauſe it is an eaſier matter
<pb facs="tcp:59160:6"/>
to overthrow an Error, than to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Truth. And altho in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this matter I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd more than many of our Divines have done, yet am I ſure, that I have followed herein the ſenſe of the Ancient Church, which is enough to juſtifie and bear me out; however, I am not ſo vain a perſon, as to pretend to be mine own Judge in this, or any other caſe.</p>
            <p>And now, Madam, ſince theſe papers are committed to the Preſs, if any ſhall wonder at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication of them, I hope no man will think it ſtrange, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to lay them at Your Graces feet, and entitle them to your Noble Patronage; if they will but conſider, that there are no Expreſſions of Dutifulneſs and Honour due from the Loweſt Servant to ſo great a Perſonage,
<pb facs="tcp:59160:6"/>
but Your Grace may lay juſt claim to them from me.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be matter of ſome diſcourſe, that I ſhould offer this to your Grace ſingly, without begging the Patronage of him too, who is your Noble Husband, and my Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Lord. And, I confeſs, I can hardly think what to ſay to the World, that in the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little Book <hi>I</hi> do not joyn Both your Graces together, who are (Bleſſed by God) in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Affection, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in all reſpects, Undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. The truth is, his Grace hath often given me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to addreſs my ſelf to him after this manner: and if my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires now are to Expreſs this my Duty to your Grace alone, <hi>I</hi> know ſuch is my Good Lords Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Your Grace, that he will
<pb facs="tcp:59160:7"/>
not think it a Fault in me, or (if the World ſhall think it ſo) will eaſily pardon it, if your Grace will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forgive my preſumption.</p>
            <p>Madam, <hi>I</hi> have no more to add now, but to beg that your Grace will favourably accept of my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Acknowledgements; and to beſeech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God whoſe good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath knit both your Graces together, that the fortunate Band may proſperouſly continue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſolved nor weakened, through the long Succeſſion of many the moſt happy years: That thoſe mutual Affections which are ſo Eminently between You Both, may Vigorouſly Hold to a good old age, and make your Graces equally Examples of the ſincereſt Love, as of Vertue and Piety. That your Grace may be a fruitful Mother of a great Race of Noble Children, to inherit your
<pb facs="tcp:59160:7"/>
Fortunes, Honour and Vertue, and to perpetuate your Names to the Worlds end: That my Young Lord, that is now in the Arms of your Love, may long live a Bleſſing to his Parents, and to the whole Nation: That in the midſt of thoſe Uncertainties, which the Courſe of this World makes us ſubject unto, the Goodneſs of God may ever Reſt upon your Graces, and on your whole Family: That God will vouchſafe to protect, guide, proſper and preſerve you, and bleſs you with all the bleſſings of heaven and earth; which is the ſincere and Earneſt Prayer of,</p>

                  </gap> miſcheivous theſe evils are likely to prove to our eſtabliſht Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State; I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe things, I humbly conceive, that the moſt effectual way to reform and recover us, is, by all poſſible and juſtifiable methods, to bring men to a right Chriſtian uſe of that ſolemn Ordinance, commonly called <hi>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> For to this Ordinance Men are bound to come with all gravity and ſeriouſneſs, with minds poſſeſt with a deep ſenſe of vertue and true Piety, with humble and holy Souls, with Spirits that are ingenuous, candid, and tractable, with hearts void of all rancour and baſeneſs, and full of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, Goodneſs and Charity; ſo that were this Ordinance duly and regularly uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with a real deſign to do our Souls good by the uſe of it, it would prove a bleſſed Reſtorative of the Life of Religion, a certain inſtrument of Concord and Love, and a moſt excellent means of making us all what we ſhould be: Good men would be at eaſe in their thoughts, and the evil part of the World would be under a neceſſity of being brought to Repentance, and we ſhould ſoon find a new heaven and a new
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59160:10"/>
earth wherein Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and whatſoever is deſirable by rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would then dwell among us.</p>
               <p>To give you the ſenſe and words of a<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> grand Exempl. <hi>p. 483.</hi>
                  </note> learned and good man, <q>If we conſider how this Sacrament is intended to unite the Spirits and affections of the World, and that it is defuſive and powerful to this purpoſe (for we are one Body, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe we are partakers of one Bread) poſſibly we may have reaſon to ſay, that the Wars of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Animoſities of Families, the infinite multitude of Law Suits, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal hatreds, and the Univerſal want of Charity, which hath made the world miſerable and wicked, may in a great degree be attributed to the neglect of this great ſymbol and inſtrument of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is upon theſe accounts, that our wiſe and watchful Governours have taken a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian and ſtrict care, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be univerſally received by all who are capable to receive it; preſuming, that if any Remedies can do us good in a Caſe ſo ſad and deſperate, the Bread of Heaven by the bleſſing of God will do it. And to promote (as much as lieth in me) ſo noble a deſign, I am reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance, to diſcourſe largely by degrees
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59160:11"/>
upon this whole Subject, in the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Didactical manner I can, and to endeavour to lead teachable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into a clear Underſtanding and full Knowledge of this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>For, as well the neglect, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of This Sacrament, doth greatly proceed from ſeveral miſtakes, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which deceived people entertain about it, the removal whereof is very neceſſary, though it will coſt a great deal of labour and Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Divers of our <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Chriſt inſtituted this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance only for the Apoſtles, and for Believers in the Apoſtles days; which vile conceit renders the uſe of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity altogether needleſs now.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Blaſphemous Hereticks the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> though they allow it to be a Sacred rite that is at ſometimes, and in ſome meaſure neceſſary by vertue of Chriſts Command, yet they deny it to contain any thing that is myſterious or <note n="a" place="margin">Opus noſtrum eſt, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil prorſus miri in ſe continens, aut prae ſe ferens. <hi>Socin. de cana Domini.</hi>

                  </note> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſort; but they look on it only as a thankful comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of Chriſts Love. Now this conceit ſerves both to make men ſlack to receive, and to make their minds very flat, and their hearts very cold, or very little affected at the receiving of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>As theſe aſcribe too little, ſo others there are who aſcribe too much to this Sacrament, being confidently perſwaded that the very Natural body of Chriſt, in which he aſcended into Heaven, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally communicated unto all, however they be inwardly qualified or diſpoſed. Now this opinion is as miſchievous as it is ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for it takes men off from preparing themſelves after a due manner, upon a groundleſs preſumption, that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Saviours body whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent heartily or no.</p>
               <p>Many among us look upon receiving to be not ſo much their Duty, as their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, taking it for granted, that they are the precious Veſſels of Election, choſen by God from all eternity, and abſolutely ordained to Eternal Life; and imagining too, that this ſolemnity is only a kind Treat on Gods part, at which they are admitted to eat as men that are ſupping with a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59160:12"/>
Friend. Now this fancy ſerves, not to humble or mortifie their Spirits, but to fill their Souls with uncharitableneſs, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs and Pride when they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and to make them rude an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent at the time of Receiving.</p>
               <p>Some again think, that if they be but unprepared (that is, if they live in a courſe of Sin) their caſe is well enough yet, if they do not come to the Sacrament; at leaſt they believe, that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without coming, and be ſaved with the greater certainty and eaſe. And this principle emboldens men to live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual breach of Chriſts Law, and opens a gap to all Wickedneſs and immorality.</p>
               <p>I have alſo known divers who have thought, that the work of preparation is not theirs (unleſs as Patients) but a work which belongs only unto God to do for them: And this Principle infus'd into them by Ignorant or ill men, encourages many to be idle, and to Sleep, waiting for the good hour when God ſhall touch them from Heaven, and preſuming that when he ſees his own time he will ſtir them, and fit them for himſelf by an immediate and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible power.</p>
               <p>There are ſome too, who though they be convinced that their own endeavours are neceſſary as workers together with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59160:12"/>
God, yet look upon the thing it ſelf to be impracticable, ſuppoſing that when they have done all they can, they cannot be prepared ſufficiently, and ſo as to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants.</p>
               <p>And beſides many well meaning people are afraid to come to the Lords, Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcared away either through a ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſome Crimes paſt, or through a great miſtruſt of themſelves for the time to come, or through falſe notions of that Preparation which is neceſſary in order to the Sacrament, and of thoſe Obligations and Tyes which it lays upon us; and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have found, that miſtakes concerning the Covenant of Grace have with-held per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (who otherwiſe have been well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) from the uſe of this moſt Solemn and weighty ordinance.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that Errors about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are ſo various, and of ſuch evil and deadly conſequence, it followeth that 'tis greatly for the intereſt, not of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons only, but of the Church in general, that people be rightly and fully inſtructed in all points relating to this Sacrament, for were we all ſo right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed and ſo unanimous, as to meet together like friends and Chriſtians at the Altar of God, we ſhould be the moſt happy Nation under the Sun.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Nature of this Sacrament. That it is a ſacrifical Feaſt. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Feaſts uſed both by Heathens and Jews. The Analogy between thoſe Ancient Feaſts, and This: Eſpecially between This and the Paſchal Supper. The uſefulneſs of this obſervation, againſt the Socinians.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat we may fully and clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Nature of this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 'tis neceſſary to ſearch into the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and bottom of the whole matter; by neglecting which ſearch many have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at randome or very Superficially of this Sacrament. Now to me it is very plain, that in inſtituting this Rite, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not inſtitute a Rite that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a new thing to the World; but rather that he ordained a Sacred Feaſt which was very like and near of Kin to thoſe Religious Feaſts that were Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59160:14"/>
and Common in all (or moſt) pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World for many and many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before; and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did <note n="*" place="margin">Certé nòn in hoc tantum ſed &amp; in Baptiſmi Sacramento videtur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino Chriſtus ſe non Hebraerum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm ſed &amp; Gentium in idem foedus cooptandarum captui accommodaſſe: <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>Matth. 26. v. 27.</hi>
                  </note> accommodate himſelf, and adapt this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity to the ordinary and vulgar apprehenſions of Mankind. Hence it is that we have ſuch a little account given us of this great Ordinance in the Scriptures, for the three Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> have given but a ſhort Hiſtorical Relation of its Inſtitution. St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed hath occaſionally ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it in one of his Epiſtles to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and holy Writers have ſaid nothing: Becauſe (as I conceive) by that Analogy, which People ſaw it to bear to other the like Myſteries, which were every where uſed, they could eaſily inform themſelves of the Meaning, of the Ends, and of the Uſe of it; they might readily conclude, that 'twas intended to be a Religious, Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Banquet, proper indeed to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but anſwerable to thoſe Religious Foederal Repaſts, which did belong both to the Religion of the Jews, and to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>For our better underſtanding of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we muſt know, that it was cuſtomary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59160:14"/>
of old, both among the blind <hi>Pagans</hi> and among the People of God, when they offered Sacrifices, to reſerve ſome part of their offerings, and then to Feaſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religiouſly upon thoſe remains. The careful obſerving and remembring of this thing will very much help us to apprehend the meaning of this Chriſtian Banquet, as in the proceſs of this diſconrſe will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. In the mean time 'tis neceſſary for us to note.</p>
               <p>1.

alſo by the Teſtimonies of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the firſt account we meet with touching this matter is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. For though it be probable, that theſe Religious Feaſts I now ſpeak of, were of as ancient inſtitution as Sacrifices themſelves, yet in this place of Scripute we find the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention of them among Idolaters. For at <hi>ver.</hi> 12. of that Chapter we read, that <hi>Jethro Moſes</hi> Father in Law, took a burnt-offering, and Sacrifices for God: And <hi>Aaron</hi> came, and all the Elders of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to eat bread (or to Feaſt) with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59160:15"/>
Father in Law, before God. This was an Euchariſtical Feaſt, whereby they gave Praiſe and thanks to God for the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now, whatever <hi>Jethro</hi> himſelf was as to his Profeſſion, if he was not an Idolater (as ſome conceive he was) yet he was the Prieſt of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who were an Idolatrous people. For ſo we find that they and the <hi>Moabites</hi> called the people (of Iſrael) unto the Sacrifices of their Gods, and that the people did eat (meaning of their Sacrifices) <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 2. There are very many places in the Holy Scripture which ſhew, how addicted the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to eat and drink before the Heathen Idols, and to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of thoſe offerings (which were made by the Heathens to their Gods) being tempted and led thereunto by the General practice of thoſe Heathen people they converſed with. But for brevity ſake I omit thoſe inſtances, becauſe they are ſubject to mens common obſervation and view, and becauſe the thing is very plain from that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the ancient Chriſtian Church, which was occaſioned by this general practice.

the Idol (<hi>i. e.</hi> believing thoſe Idols to be true Deities, and thoſe Idol-Feaſts to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable unto them) unto this hour eat it, ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. To ſtop this evil courſe, a Canon was made at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould abſtain from Meats offered unto Idols, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And<note place="margin">

               <p>Now this doth ſufficiently ſhew, that Feaſting upon Sacrifice was generally uſed of old even among Heathen nations; and the obſervation hereof together with the Knowledge of the meaning and ends of thoſe Heathen Feaſts, will very much help us to underſtand the full meaning and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Chriſtian-Feaſt. For this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Banquet doth reſemble, and is Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous unto thoſe Religious Banquets which all people were wont to celebrate after the offering up of their Sacrifices: For as they Feaſted upon a Sacrificed Beaſt, ſo we feaſt upon a Sacrificed Jeſus: But with this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference; firſt, that our Sacrifice is not repeated (as theirs was) but was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up once for all upon the Croſs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that whereas they did eat the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder and the very ſubſtance of their Sacrifices, we do not Feaſt upon the very
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59160:16"/>
Numerical Fleſh of the Holy Lamb of God, but inſtead of eating after ſuch a Groſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we partake of Bread and Wine, which are ſubſtituted in the Room of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Natural Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p>It is uncertain indeed how the Heathens came by this Cuſtom of uſing Sacrifical Banquets, whether they had<note place="margin">Apud Graecos aliasque Gentes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpabatur, ut qui victimas offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent de earum carne epularentur: ſive id ab Hebraeorum exemplo ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem traxit, ſeu, quod eſt probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius à communium parentum inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis, <hi>Grot. in Matt. 26. ver. 26.</hi>

But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and plain, that Feaſts of this Nature were very uſual among the Jews. And for the right underſtanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we muſt know that there were three ſorts of Sacrifices, which the Jews were wont to offer. 1. <hi>Holocauſts</hi> or burnt Offerings, (which they preſented unto God, as the Creator and Lord of all things.) 2. <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Victims, diſtinguiſht into Sin Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Treſpaſs-Offerings, (which by way of Attonement they preſented unto God, as the Judge and Avenger of all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.) And 3. Peace-Offerings, which were either by way of thankſgiving for Mercies already received, or by way of Prayer for the obtaining of more Mercies ſtill, (which they preſented to God as the Author and Giver of all good things.) Now theſe Peace Offerings were divided into

three parts: The Blood and the Fat were offered upon the Altar, as<note place="margin">

In like manner the Jews were wont to do at their Sacrifical Banquets. A very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inſtance whereof we have 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 4, 5. where we read of <hi>Elkanah,</hi> that after he had Sacrificed, he gave to <hi>Peninnah</hi> and to all her Sons, and her Daughters, Portions; but unto <hi>Hannah</hi> he gave a double portion.

               <p>Now this very cuſtome was obſerved in the Primitive Church of Chriſt (to be ſure in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> time) when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament was done. For ſo that very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59160:18"/>
ancient Writer tells us expreſly, that the diſtribution and participation of the Holy Bread and Wine being ended, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſent by the Deacons to thoſe Chriſtians (the Sick and Infirm) that were<note place="margin">Juſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Apol. 2.</hi>
                  </note> abſent, which Conformity of their with Pagans and Jews in point of practice, doth plainly ſhew, that they reckoned this their Solemnity to be Analogous, and like to thoſe other which were uſed by Pagans and all the Jews over world; <hi>Viz.</hi> a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Feaſt.</p>
               <p>But St <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe doth ſeem to put the thing beyond all manner of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where he argues againſt the lawfulneſs of participating of Idol-Feaſts, from that plain Analogy which the Lords Supper beareth thereunto. And thus he demonſtrates the point. Firſt, that they who did eat of the Jewiſh Sacrifices, did profeſs to be in Communion with the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Behold <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh: Are not they which eat of the Sacrifices par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Altar? <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Secondly, that in like manner they, who did participate of the Heathen-Sacrifices which had been offered unto <hi>Demons,</hi> did profeſs to be in Communion and to have fellowſhip with thoſe <hi>Demons, ver.</hi> 20. Thirdly, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle infers, that the Chriſtian-Feaſt being the participation of the Body and Blood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59160:18"/>
of Chriſt (as he ſhew'd, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for men to partake of meats offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto Idols without renouncing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; theſe two things being ſo utterly incompatible, that <hi>we cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils; we cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and the Table of Devils.</hi> ver. 21. As the Idol-Feaſts were Sacrifical Banquets proper to the Heathens: and as the Moſaical-Feaſts were Sacrifical Banquets proper to the Jews; ſo this our Feaſt is a Sacrifical Banquet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Chriſtians, and we may no more dare to eat of this, and the other Feaſts too, then we may dare now to be Circumciſed and turn Pagans after Baptiſm. This is the meaning and argumentation of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and it plainly ſhews, that there is a great Analogy, likeneſs, and reſemblance between this, and thoſe other myſteries, as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, though the reaſons, the uſes and reſpects are far different and utterly irreconcilable. It is indeed a Sacrifical Feaſt as the others of old were; but ſuch a one as was inſtituted for the Diſciples of Chriſt, ſuch a one as is intended for our partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of Chriſt, for the tying of us to Chriſt, ſuch a one as immediately Refers to Chriſt, ſuch a one as directly tends to the Worſhipping of Chriſt, and of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59160:19"/>But then we muſt note, that of all the Sacrifical Banquets under the Law, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper was that, which this Chriſtian Feaſt beareth the greateſt Analogy unto. This appeareth ſeveral ways. 1. Becauſe the Holy Jeſus is called Our Paſſeover, the Lamb that was ſlain to this purpoſe (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) that we might Feed on him with all manner of inward, Spiritual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the Feaſt, not with old Leaven, neither with the Leaven of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſs; but with the unleavened Bread of ſincerity and Truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8. 2. Becauſe this Banquet was inſtituted at the cloſe of the Paſſeover-Supper,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. on <hi>Joh. 13. 26.</hi>

St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> both expreſsly affirm of the Cup, that Chriſt took it <hi>after Supper.</hi> 3. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of this Chriſtian Feaſt are the ſame with what were uſed at the Paſchal Supper, excepting ſuch things as were either Typical, or of peculiar ſignification to the Jews.

and Peculiar uſe to the Sons of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In like manner, the Lamb was a figure of Chriſt to come, and the roaſting of the Lamb upon a Spit was a repreſentation of<note n="*" place="margin">

But the other parts of the Paſchal Feaſt, the Bread and Wine, Chriſt continued the the uſe of them, and order'd them to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtill by his Church in all places, and to all Ages. 4. The manner of celebrating the Paſchal Feaſt was very like to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which this Banquet was celebrated; and that in two reſpects (beſides that of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution.)</p>
               <p>1. Firſt in reſpect of thoſe Benedictions<note place="margin">See <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyns</hi> Antiq. 1. 3. c. 2.</note> which the Jews then offered up to God, for creating bread and Wine, for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Feſtival, for their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the Covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the Law.

which was then (in a manner) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompliſht.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly in reſpect of thoſe Solemn Commemorations which did attend the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Paſſeover. For this peculiar Ceremony the Jews uſed at that time, that the Maſter of the houſe, where the Lamb was eaten, did inſtruct the reſt touching that Solemn Myſtery, and did open unto them the meaning of it; declaring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that the Lamb before them was called the Paſſeover, becauſe God paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">

In like manner this Chriſtian Ordinance is a ſtanding Memorial of the Divine Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, at which the Love of God in giving his everlaſting Son, and the Compaſſions of Jeſus in giving up himſelf to die for us are ſolemnly Agnized, and the Redemption of the whole World publickly Celebrated; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, the <hi>Annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or the <hi>ſhewing forth of the

               <p>By this that has been ſpoken, it doth plainly appear, that this Holy Solemnity is Analogous and anſwerable to thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Feaſts which were uſed of old, and eſpecially to the Paſchal Feaſt, which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will help us, not only to underſtand fully the purport of this Myſtery, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to baffle the pretences of thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Hereticks, the Socinians, who give a very mean and contemptuous account of the Lords Supper. For they take no notice of any ſtrict engagements it lays upon us to an Holy Life: they believe not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be a Seal of Gods favour and Grace; ſo far are they from owning this, that <hi>Socinus</hi> had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence<note place="margin">Multo praeſtantior ſine dubio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu veteris faederis fuit ſanguis ille pecudum, quam reſpectu no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi ſit panis ille &amp; vinum. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. ad Epiſt.

                  </note> to ſay, that the blood of Beaſts under the Law was of Greater efficacy and value, than the Bread and Wine in this Ordinance. They ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny that we hereby Receive any thing at the hands of God; nor will they indure us to ſay, that Gods Spirit is here given, or that our Faith is here increaſed, or that pardon of ſin is here tendered, or that we receive here any Pledge of a bleſſed Reſurrection and a glorious Immortality. No; they explode all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines

                  </note> that the proper end for which the Lords Supper was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted is this, that we may Commemorate the Lords Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Nay <hi>Socinus</hi> was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">—In caena Domini ne ipſam quidem mentionem Chriſti cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris pro nobis traditi, &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis fuſi diſertis verbis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendam neceſſariam plane eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. <hi>Socin de uſu &amp; fine Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Dom.</hi>
                  </note> that 'tis not neceſſary ſo much as to make expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Body being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, or of his blood being poured out for us; which yet is inconſiſtent with his own Principle; for how can we Commemorate the Death of our Bleſſed Saviour, without making mention of it? Briefly, theſe Blaſphemous Hereticks look upon this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance only as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial<note place="margin">Vide Excerpta ex ore Socini in fine diſputationis de uſu &amp; fine caenae Domini.</note> of a Friends kindneſs: This is all they will allow; and ſo they conclude, that we may Celebrate it either ſitting, or ſtanding, or with our Heads covered; or with Water, if we will inſtead of Wine; but to kneel, or ſo much as to ſigh with eyes lifted up at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, is, in their account, a kind of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, theſe ill concluſions do for the moſt part follow from that unſound Principle, that the Supper of the Lord was intended only in Commemoration of him. But what reaſon and ground have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59160:21"/>
they for this Principle? Why,<note place="margin">Non ullus alius, praeter hunc a Chriſto eſt indicatus finis. <hi>Cat. Eccl. Pol.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe (ſay they) at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution Chriſt mentioned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this end, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> But this is not a reaſon and ground ſufficient. For the mentioning of one end is not the excluding of others. though Chriſt in expreſs terms had ſaid no more, yet it doth not follow that no more was intended. The very Analogy which this Feaſt beareth to other the like Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Feaſts of old, and eſpecially to the Paſchal Feaſt, is enough to ſhew us the ſeveral Ends of it, had our Saviour menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned no end at all. And this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I have now taken notice of that Analogy. For if ſuch Feaſts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed to be Covenant-Rites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, then we may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably believe, that this is to be reputed ſo too. If to eat the body of a roaſted Lamb, was a Pledge of Gods favour to the Jews, then we may infer, that to eat Bread, inſtead of Chriſts body, is a pledge of Gods favour to us Chriſtians. If the uſe of other Sacrifical Feaſts did entitle the partakers to all thoſe Benefits, for which the Sacrifices were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; then we may conclude, that the uſe of this Sacrifical Feaſt doth entitle the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to all thoſe benefits, for which Chriſt our Sacrifice, offered up himſelf, and which he purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59160:22"/>Therefore the Socinians do but trifle, and are very vain in pretending to teach us the full meaning of this Rite, when they take no notice of that correſpondence and Analogy which is between this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient Rites of the like nature. For this is a principal thing to be taken notice of; and we cannot eaſily conceive, what elſe it was which ſatisfied the Apoſtles touching the purport of this Ordinance, when it was inſtituted firſt. For, that they preſently diſcerned the meaning of it, is clear; becauſe we do not find, that they deſired of our Lord any explanation at all of this myſtery. In other caſes they were very inquiſitive, and ſometimes about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which we think had little need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, being obvious to Men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary capacities. And yet at the inſtitution of this Holy Sacrament, tho it containeth ſome things ſo difficult and dark (to us) that they have occaſioned Quarrels in all parts of the Chriſtian world, yet the Diſciples were who ly ſilent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſenſible what ſuch Sacred Feaſts did mean in thoſe days, and what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe of Mankind was about them. They could not but know, that by eating of things which bad been offered at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, men undertook to obſerve that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to which that ſacred Rite did belong,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59160:22"/>
and whereof it was a part. They could not but know, that by ſuch an action they had a right to thoſe benefits, which the Sacrifice had been offered up for, and ſo they became very nearly related to God as his Favourites, and Family. And when they found, by our Saviouts diſcourſe, that he would offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for them, and heard him now ſay of the bread in his hands, this is my Body, they might eaſily apprehend him to mean, that they were to eat of Bread in the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Room</hi> of his fleſh, and <hi>inſtead</hi> of feeding upon his Natural Body. Conſidering that the Lamb which was dreſt for the Paſchal-Supper was uſually called the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> no ſooner did Chriſt call the Loaf, <hi>His Body,</hi> but they did inſtantly conceive, it was appointed to be eaten <hi>for</hi> his Body, and <hi>in liew</hi> of it, eſpecially ſince he had told them before, that they were not to feed on him, as they were wont to feed upon the Lamb, after a carnal and croſs manner, becauſe <hi>the Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> Joh. 6. 63. Hence they ſaw preſently, that this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did very much reſemble the Sacrifical Banquets which had been obſerved of old (only it was of a more Noble importance and ſignification) and ſo they troubled not the Lord with enquiries, being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſatisfied of the Nature and meaning of ſuch ſolemnities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59160:23"/>And this we may ſuppoſe to have been the Reaſon too, why we find ſo few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament about preparing our ſelves for a worthy eating of this Bleſſed Sacrament. For there is little, or nothing ſaid upon this Subject, ſetting aſide what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> once occaſionally ſaid of ſelf examination in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. For the thing was not ſo very needful; becauſe ſuch directions might eaſily be drawn even from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Nature and ends of this Holy Banquet, and men already had great impreſſions and apprehenſions of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in order to a due celebration of thoſe Solemnities, to which this Myſtery was Parallel and Analogous. With what Religion did the very Heathens prepare themſelves, by waſhing their Bodies, and by abſtaining from worldly and Carnal Pleaſures, before they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Tables of their Gods? And with what care and curioſity did the Jews pick every Crum of Leaven out of their houſes, and uſe other obſervances, before they preſumed to eat of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover? The very reſemblance and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between this Myſtery and that, is enough to miniſter directions, about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and purifying our Spirits in order to it, and whatſoever is neceſſary in that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59160:23"/>
point, may be eaſily gathered and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the conſideration of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and reaſon of this Holy Rite. All which is loſt, by mens taking no notice of that Analogy which it bears to other Sacrifical Feaſts; and therefore it is no wonder, that the Socinians ſpeak ſo coldly of this matter, and that they are as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial and ſlight about the buſineſs of preparation, as they are ſlovenly, Rude, and irreverent at the Celebration of this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being laid down as the Foundation and Ground-work of what I have to ſay upon this ſubject, the task I have undertaken will be attended with the fewer difficulties, the true notion of this Sacrament will be the more readily conceived, the great errors about it will be the more eaſily removed, the truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it will be ſettled with the greater firmneſs and ſolidity, and every thing will be apprehended (I hope) with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſpicuity, and clearneſs; which is the thing that I much aim at in this whole matter.</p>
               <p>The ſum briefly is this; that this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rite is a Sacrifical Banquet, which beareth ſome proportionable likeneſs to thoſe Sacrifical Banquets, which were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly Celebrated of Old by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59160:24"/>
of mankind: So that as Jews and Heathens were wont to feed upon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Beaſt, ſo we Chriſtians do feed upon a Sacrificed Redeemer: after a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> manner we feed upon the <hi>Figure</hi> of him; that is, we partake of Bread inſtead of that his Fleſh (which is his <hi>Natural</hi> Body;) but after a <hi>Spiritual</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we feed upon him <hi>Himſelf;</hi> that is, we partake of his Virtues and Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which is his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body.)</p>

               <p>THe Nature of this Myſtery being unfolded, proceed we in the next place to conſider the Ends and Purpoſes for which it was appointed.</p>

                  </gap>, which is the expreſſion in the Original. 1. Some render it, <hi>Recordatio;</hi> as if this ſolemnity was intended to put men in mind of Chriſts paſſion and to bring his Love to their remembrance. Nor have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59160:25"/>
the Socinians ſufficient reaſon<note place="margin">Niſi quis antequam illuc accedat, non modo rectè mortis Chriſti me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minerit, ſed ejus efficaciam &amp; fructumjam interiore animo guſtet ac ſentiat, indignus planè eſt, qui eò accedat. <hi>Socin. ubi Supra.</hi>
                  </note> to quarrel with this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe (as they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue) men ought to remember the Lords Paſſion <hi>before</hi> they come to the Lords Supper. 'Tis true, we ought to do ſo; and 'tis as true that this ſolemnity is a proper means to <hi>excite</hi> us to do ſo, to engage us to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter ſome time for antecedent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to conſider of the Divine goodneſs, and of our own unworthineſs before hand, to view the ſeveral parts of our Saviours Life and ſufferings, and to obſerve the greatneſs of his love throughout the whole, that we may come to the Holy Table with ſouls poſſeſt with a deep ſenſe of God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and with hearts full of zeal, of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, of repentance, and of Devotion; which we are apt at other times not to be ſo ſolicitouſly careful of. At the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſſeover, the Jews were commanded to take the Lamb into their houſes on the <hi>tenth day of Niſan,</hi> and to Keep it up until the fourteenth of the ſame Month, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And one reaſon which the Jews give of this is, that in thoſe four days, by having the Lamb under their eye, they<note place="margin">Paul Fagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 12.</hi>
                  </note> might be ſtirred up to continual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conferences of their Redemption out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for which reaſon they have a Tradition
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59160:25"/>
on among them, that during thoſe four days the Lamb was tyed by a bed-ſide. And thus do the thoughts of this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Feaſt, when it is near at hand, very much ſerve to <hi>excite</hi> men to the moſt ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the Redemption of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by that <hi>Lamb of God</hi> which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the World. And beſides, the breaking of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the <hi>Wine,</hi> together with the <hi>mention</hi> that then is made of our Lords death, do abundantly ſerve to <hi>imprint</hi> in our minds a memory of the Paſſion after a moſt lively end efficacious manner; ſo that it is not in any wiſe an <hi>Unfit or Improper</hi> way of ſpeaking, to ſay that this Sacrament is unto us a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of our Duty.</p>
               <p>2. But ſecondly, the generality of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines render the Word (as the Socinians do) <hi>Commemoratio;</hi> meaning, that this Myſtery was appointed as a Teſt of mens conſtancy, that to the Worlds end they might publickly <hi>Profeſs</hi> their Faith in a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Redeemer, by <hi>ſhewing, forth</hi> their dear Lords death, and by conſtantly celebrating the memorial of his bitter, but meritorious Paſſion.

Briefly, though the Holy Jeſus was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to die when he inſtituted this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet his deſign was to live for ever in the hearts of his Diſciples: and becauſe nothing is more common among men (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit nothing unbecomes men more) than to let the Remembrance of Gods mercies, ſlide away from them, and to Bury his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in Oblivion, therefore to help our infirmities Chriſt ordained a perpetual uſe of this Holy Banquet, that his Fathers and his own Love might be had in everlaſting

               <p>And before I let this point go out of my hands, there are two things which I would note from this conſideration.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, that at this Bleſſed Sacrament there is not any <hi>New Sacrificing,</hi> or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of Chriſt to expiate Sin, but only a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of his Death, a <hi>Memorial</hi> of that <hi>One</hi> Sacrifice which he offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father when he offered up himſelf upon the Croſs for us. The Romaniſts are ſtrongly perſwaded, that as the ſubſtance of Chriſts Natural Body is really in the

Hoſt, ſo he is really, truly and literally Sacrificed there, as a Propitiatory Oblation both for the living and the Dead too. But 'tis a modeſt cenſure to ſay (for 'tis the the leaſt we can ſay) of this conceit, that 'tis a very fond and groundleſs fancy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither from our Saviours words at the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> nor from St. <hi>Pauls Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the Story, nor from the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Analogy</hi> of this Feaſt, can we gather any thing that gives Colour to this Principle; it being apparent every way, that Chriſt intended this Myſtery, not that he ſhould ſuffer in it <hi>a freſh,</hi> or be Sacrificed in it <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh,</hi> but that we ſhould thereby Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate and ſhew forth his Paſſion in <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha.</hi> Indeed in ſome caſes the ſame thing may be ſaid to be a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of a Sacrifice, and a <hi>true Sacrifice</hi> alſo; as the Paſchal Lamb at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was truly a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and a Memorial too of the Lamb that was ſacrificed in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be ſo in this caſe, becauſe 'tis Contradictory to the Apoſtles <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, where he ſhews, that Chriſts Sacrificing of himſelf, had this <hi>Prerogative,</hi> this dignity above all <hi>Legal</hi> Oblations, that it needed not (as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did) any <hi>Repeating,</hi> whereas the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law were offered <hi>year by year continually, and every Prieſt ſtood

Miniſtring and offering oftentimes the ſame Sacrifices, Chriſt our High Prieſt offered one perfect Sacrifice for ſins for ever, and ſo ſate down on the right hand of God, by that one offering of himſelf having perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, and having ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them through the offering of his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy once for all.</hi> So that unleſs we will give the Apoſtle the Lie, we cannot affirm any Propitiatory Sacrifice to be in this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

But to call the Sacrament a Sacrifice, or the Holy Table an Alter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſumption that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and in his Natural Body offered up there, is a Solaeciſm in Divinity, and that which is utterly <hi>againſt</hi> the ſenſe of the Ancient Doctors of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>For though in many Liturgies and other Ancient Books, we often find mention to be made of Oblations and Sacrifices at the Celebration of the Holy Sacrament, yet this is meant of thoſe ſacrifices and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which I have now ſpoken of, and which all Reformed Churches allow of: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Ancients point to thoſe Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Gifts,</hi> which Chriſtians in thoſe times brought with them to the Church, to be preſented and offered up to God on the Holy Table, as an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the whole Earth was the Lords, and as a Grateful Recognition of his <hi>Right</hi> to all, of his <hi>Dominion</hi> over all, and of his <hi>propriety</hi> in all the poſſeſſions they did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.

                  </gap> in <hi>Memory</hi> of that Paſſion which Chriſt was pleaſed to undergo for us Men, and for our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>I have noted all this to ſhew, how, groſly the Romaniſts are deceived in that which many poor wretches among them take to be a main part of Religion, tho I am afraid their Crafty Guides tell them ſo for their own <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Advantage.</hi> For do but take away the Doctrine of Chriſt being really Sacrificed under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread and Wine, and their <hi>Maſſes</hi> for Quick and Dead muſt go away next,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59160:32"/>
then the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> muſt down too, then the Practice of praying for ſouls ſuppoſed to be in <hi>Torments</hi> there, muſt down alſo, and then the conceit of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and divers other <hi>Lucrative</hi> Arts, whereby the Knaviſh Prieſts cheat ignorant and Eaſie People out of their Mony; till in the end, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way firſt one ſhore and then another, the old rotten Houſe drops down upon their Heads, which hath been held up hitherto by <hi>this</hi> Artificial Prop (among others) that our bleſſed Saviour is <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> offered up a Sacrifice for all men in this Myſtery, whereas indeed it is not a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of him, but a <hi>Repreſentation</hi> and <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> of the great Sacrifice upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p>2. That which I would note in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is, that this Bleſſed Sacrament was intended to be, not a Memorial of the <hi>Paſſeover-Supper,</hi> which Chriſt Celebrated the ſame Night that he was betray'd, but a Commemoration of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> on the day following. This indeed is very obvious and eaſie to be obſerved: And yet for want of minding this thing well, many weak people among our ſelves have been unfortunately lead aſide into wrong and ſuperſtitious conceits, about ſome <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> which relate to this ſolemnity. Becauſe the Paſſeover was eaten at <hi>Night,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59160:33"/>
therefore ſome conclude, that this <hi>Sacrament</hi> ought not to be ſolemniz'd at any other time. And becauſe our Saviour and his Diſciples did (as they ſuppoſe) eat the Paſſeover <hi>Sitting,</hi> therefore theſe men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that it is not lawful for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament in a <hi>Kneeling</hi> poſture. They would have us to be guided by thoſe Uſages and Rites which were obſerved at the <hi>Paſchal-Feaſt,</hi> as if the Cuſtomes then were preſidents to govern and direct us now, and as if this Feaſt of ours were not only <hi>Analagous</hi> unto, but alſo a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> and Memorial of that Feſtival a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews. But all this is nothing but a Rope of ſand, and any man may find it ſo, that will but conſider the thing rightly. For this being a ſacrifical Banquet, at which we do Commemorate the intollerable ſufferings, and infinite Love of the Son of God, ſuch Rituals are to be obſerved now as are moſt <hi>Congruous</hi> and <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of this Myſtery. As for the Paſſeover-Supper, it is ceaſed and out of doors long ago, together with thoſe obſervances which were belonging and appendant to it, and we have nothing to do with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were grounded upon <hi>ſpecial</hi> rea. ſons, and were of <hi>proper</hi> uſe, and of <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> ſignificancy to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Thus the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59160:33"/>
                  <hi>Time</hi> of its Celebration was to be at Night, becauſe it was in the <hi>Night time,</hi> that the Lord ſmote the firſt born of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and paſſed over the houſes of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and this concerns us no more than it concerns us to Celebrate the very <hi>Day</hi> of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus alſo for the <hi>Poſture</hi> uſed at the eating of the Paſſeover, at firſt it was probably a <hi>Standing</hi> poſture, becauſe the Jews were commanded to eat it with their <hi>Loyns gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with their ſhooes on their Feet, and with their Staff in their hand.</hi> But there were <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> reaſons for this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; for it was <hi>Significative</hi> and in <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> of their great <hi>Haſte;</hi> and that concerns <hi>us</hi> no more neither, than it concerns us to eat <hi>Unleavened</hi> Bread which was in token of their Haſte alſo. In our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours time the Poſture was <hi>Altered</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew in its due place) and 'twas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding nor ſitting (as many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mem conceive) but a <hi>Recumbent</hi> and <hi>Leaning</hi> poſture, one gueſt lying along in the boſome of another, as (St. <hi>John</hi> lay in our Lords Boſome) ſo making part of a Round or Oval figure. And even <hi>This</hi> poſture was of <hi>peculiar</hi> fignificancy to the Jews too, for it was in Token that their <hi>Journey</hi> and Travels were at an <hi>End,</hi> and that they were poſſeſt of the Land of <hi>Reſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59160:34"/>
which God had ſworn to their Fathers, that he would give them. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hence can we gather any thing that bindes us, unleſs it be this, that in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial matters we ſhould ſubmit to thoſe innocent uſages, which either the Laws, or Cuſtomes of a Nation, or the Reaſon of times have introduced, as our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf did, who took ſuch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes as they <hi>were,</hi> and obſerved them as he <hi>found</hi> them, not troubling the World with debates and Controverſies about things of nothing.</p>
               <p>So then, the Rites uſed at the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are no <hi>Leading</hi> Rites to us, nor are we to Copy out that pattern any more than we are Commemorate the Jews feaſt. This Sacrament of ours is not a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Paſchal Supper, but of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemers <hi>Death;</hi> and accordingly we are to uſe ſuch Rituals as are moſt <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the meaning and purpoſe of this Myſtery, and moſt ſignificative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Us.</hi> Conſidering that it was between <hi>Nine</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> of the Clock, that our dear Lord was hurried to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> nailed to the Croſs, and there hung upon four wounds, languiſhing, bleeding, dying with pangs and throws unſpeakable, unconceivable, it is proper for us to Celebrate about <hi>Noon</hi> this Bleſſed Sacrament, which is the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59160:34"/>
of his Great Paſſion. Conſidering too the <hi>Intendments</hi> of this Myſtery, that it ſerveth (as I ſhall prove as I go along) to engage us to be faithful and True to the Redeemer of our Souls, and to convey unto us all thoſe benefits, which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us by his Paſſion, as Pardon of Sin, the Communication of his Bleſſed body and Blood, the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a cloſe Union with him, and an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a glorious Immortality; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo what <hi>We</hi> are, that the Divine Goodneſs ſhould be thus propitious and kind to us, his <hi>Unworthy, Deſpicable,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Sinful</hi> Creatures, I appeal to any man of ſenſe and true humility, if it be not moſt <hi>proper,</hi> moſt <hi>becoming</hi> us (were Laws and Cuſtomes altogether <hi>ſilent</hi>) to receive the bleſſed inſtruments and Pledges of the Divine Grace in the <hi>Lowlyeſt,</hi> in the moſt <hi>Reverent,</hi> in the moſt <hi>Humble</hi> poſture, and after ſuch a manner as is moſt <hi>expreſſive</hi> of that ſenſe we ought to have of our own Vileneſs and nothingneſs, and of the Love of Jeſus. When I, who am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that the Lord ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my <hi>Roof,</hi> am invited to come ſo near unto him, as to lie (as it were) not in his <hi>Boſome,</hi> but in his <hi>Heart</hi> too, and to take into my hands the Holy Seals of his deareſt Love, of his tendereſt and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59160:35"/>
Compaſſions, then be thou Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, O my Soul; let me then <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>fall down,</hi> and <hi>Kneel</hi> before the Lord my Redeemer, and if there be any thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the Duſt, or any place lower and baſer than the Earth, let my ſinful Body grovel and lie there. Thus the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of this Sacrament, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that it ſerves to Commemorate, not what the <hi>Jews</hi> did at their Paſchal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but what <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our true Paſſeover, did in being Sacrificed for us, are enough to take any humble man <hi>off</hi> from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard which Superſtitious Perſons have of ſuppoſed Jewiſh poſtures; becauſe we are not to repreſent and Commemorate <hi>their Actions,</hi> but to ſhew forth the bitter <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of the Holy <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice to be ſaid, as the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Improvement</hi> of this matter; that this Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical ſolemnity was intended to be a a perpetual and ſtanding Memorial of our Saviours ſufferings and Love: <hi>Do this in Remembrance,</hi> in Commemoration of me: That's one great End of this ſacrifical Banquet.</p>

               <p>BY the leave of the Socinians we will go further, and confidently affirm, that this Holy Sacrament is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to another End too, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be a Federal Rite, or a Covenant ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet between God and the Communicants. By a Covenant is meant, ſuch a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Allyance, and League with God, whereby he claimeth a peculiar right, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and propriety in us, as in thoſe who have devoted our ſelves to his Worſhip

For the opening of it therefore we muſt know, that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſual for People, eſpecially in the Eaſtern parts of the World, to make and ratifie Contracts by eating and drinking together. Of this the Holy Scriptures give us ſome plain Exemples. For that Feaſt which <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> celebrated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 30. was a Covenant-Feaſt, a token and ſymbol of Friendſhip between them. <hi>Labans</hi> eating with <hi>Jacob</hi> upon an heap of ſtones, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 46. was no other then a Foederal rite. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eating of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Victuals, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 14. was the contracting of a League with thoſe crafty people, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were blameable for doing without asking Counſel at the mouth of the Lord; for had they firſt enquired of God, they had not been Circumvented, as they were into a

confederacy with them. When <hi>David</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an upbraiding manner ſpake of his friends treachery (in words which are very appicable to <hi>Judas) Pſal.</hi> 41. 9. mine own familiar Friend (ſaid he) in whom I truſted, which did eat <hi>of my Bread,</hi> hath lift up his heel againſt me: He meant one, that had entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him by a <hi>Feaſt</hi> (as you find that <hi>Abner</hi> did in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 20.) and therefore inſtead of a <hi>Friend,</hi> 'tis otherwiſe rendred in the Margin of our Bibles, the man of my <hi>peace,</hi>

               <p>1. That thoſe Religious Feaſts which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59160:37"/>
the old Heathens celebrated before their Idols, were viſible Rites whereby they Covenanted with thoſe imaginary Deities.</p>
               <p>2. That thoſe Sacrifical Feaſts, which were obſerved by Gods people, according to the Law, were viſible rites too, whereby they Covenanted with the true God.</p>
               <p>3. That this Sacrifical, Chriſtian Feaſt, which we partake of, according to the Goſpel, is a viſible Rite alſo, whereby we Covenant with the Bleſſed Jeſus. The proof of theſe three things will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I hope, to clear this matter.</p>
               <p>1. That thoſe Religious Feaſts which were Celebrated by the old Heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Idols, were viſible Rites where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they Covenanted with thoſe imaginary Deities. So they were reputed to have been by God himſelf: for when the Jews were ſo fooliſh as to grow fond of thoſe Heathen Rites, and to be taken with them, God charged them as guilty of a Sin of the Higheſt nature, as <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as thoſe that had <hi>forſaken</hi> him and his Covenant, and as thoſe that had really and actually <hi>joyned</hi> themſelves to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idols; which could not be true, if thoſe Sacrifical Feaſts of the Heathens had not been <hi>Foederal</hi> or Covenant Rites.

               <p>To all which let me add in the laſt place, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the eating of thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Sacrifices, the having of <hi>Fellowſhip with Devils;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20.

               <p>2. This then being ſo clear; I proceed to ſhew in the ſecond place, that thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Feaſts which were uſed by the Jews according to the Law, were alſo viſible and cuſtomary Rites, whereby they Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with the true God.

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59160:40"/>
went up to God, and ſaw his Glory on the Mount, and there did <hi>Eat and Drink</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>ver,</hi> II. It was a Sacrifical-Feaſt, which they Celebrated in their own names, and in the Names of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to confirm and ratifie that <hi>Covenant</hi> which they had openly, and univerſally engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep. For want of minding which thing, many learned Expoſitors and the <hi>Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſt</hi> himſelf, have been ſtrangely miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their ſenſe of that place of Scripture.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but the Paſchal Supper was a Foederal rite too, as other the like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifical Feaſts were. For <hi>Moſes</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a memorial of the Paſſeover in <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. gave this as one Reaſon of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. it ſhall be a ſign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes; that the Lords Law may be in thy mouth: Meaning that the Paſchal Solemnity was to be a Token and ſign of their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, to put them in mind of thoſe Obligations they were under to perform the Terms of that Covenant, which was ſealed with the blood of the Lamb. Nay, if the Paſſeover had not been a very So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Foederal Banquet, we cannot eaſily conceive why ſtrangers and uncircumciſed perſons were forbidden to eat of it; For the Law was very ſtrict and expreſs as to that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. No ſtranger ſhall Eat
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59160:41"/>
thereof; but every mans ſervant that is bought for mony, when thou haſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed him, then ſhall he eat thereof; a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner and hired Servant ſhall not Eat thereof. The reaſon is plain and obvious, becauſe the Paſchal Solemnity was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-rite, which did not belong unto thoſe, who did not belong to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God had made with his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus made it evident, that the Sacrifical Feaſts of old were <hi>Foederal</hi> or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Myſteries, and were ſo eſteemed both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi>

                  </note> I proceed now to ſhew in the third place, that this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Feaſt is a ſolemnity of the like Nature. For tho we ſhould ſuppoſe, that nothing to this purpoſe was ſaid at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, yet the very <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy</hi> and <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> that is between this and other Sacrifical Banquets, doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently argue, that this Solemnity was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be a Federal rite between the Church and Chriſt. This is the very principle upon which the Apoſtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where going about to ſhew how unlawful it is for Chriſtians to eat of things offered to Idols, he layeth down this Propoſition, that by a due uſe of this Bleſſed Sacrament
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59160:41"/>
we Communicate of Chriſts Body and Blood, and are Foederally united to him; ſo that as the Loaf we eat of, is one, even ſo are we <hi>one Body</hi> (with Chriſt our Head) by being partakers of that <hi>one Loaf.</hi> This is the meaning and ſubſtance of the 16. and 17. verſes. And, to make this the more evident, he draws a <hi>Parallel,</hi> and ſhews the <hi>Analogy</hi> between this and other Sacrifical Banquets. <hi>Behold</hi> Iſrael <hi>after the fleſh</hi> (ver. 18.) <hi>are not they which eat of the Sacrifices, partakers of the Altar? i. e.</hi> are they not in Foederal Communion with God, whoſe Altar it is? Why even ſo, they who ſacrifice to Devils, are in Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Communion with Devils, are joyned to Devils, have Fellowſhip with Devils; and therefore it is not lawful for us to eat of thoſe Sacrifices, becauſe it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to Communicate with Devils and with Chriſt too. This is a plain and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proof that this Evangelical Myſtery is (as other Myſteries of the like Nature anciently were) a viſible Rite of <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides the <hi>Analogy</hi> of this ſacrifical Feaſt, our Saviours words at the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do ſufficiently ſhew it to be a <hi>Foederal</hi> Ceremony: For ſpeaking of the Cup, or of the Wine in the Cup, he ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Covenant</hi> (for ſo it ſhould

                  </note> of the World, for men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenants by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Blood,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others have rightly obſerved. But becauſe this was an inhumane way, people that were more civilized, were wont to enter into Pacts and Covenants by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Wine</hi> inſtead of Blood. Now ſince our Saviour ſaid, that the Wine in his hands (which was <hi>inſtead</hi> of his Blood, and a Symbol of it) was the Cup of the new Covenant, we may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that he did intend this as a <hi>Foederal</hi> Solemnity, as an Obſiguation of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59160:43"/>
and Engagements which are on the Churches part, and on his part alſo. The <hi>Socinians</hi> therefore do abuſe the World with a very great Error in teaching, that there is no manner of <hi>Obſignation</hi> at the Lords Supper: For the thing is evident and clear, that this is a <hi>Covenant-Ordinance;</hi> and then it muſt follow (as I ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter) that here we do ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate to <hi>God</hi> that we will live up to Chriſts Religion according to our Power, and that God doth alſo ſtipulate to <hi>us,</hi> that upon our ſo doing he will perform all thoſe promiſes of Grace and mercy which he hath made to the Church in his only begotten.</p>
               <p>To this that hath been ſaid it may add a little ſtrength if we obſerve that our bleſſed Saviour himſelf expreſt the making of Covenants under the the notion of <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Drinking.</hi> So he repreſents Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites pleading for themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26. <hi>We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence:</hi> Meaning, that ſome may profeſs to be in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, and to hold <hi>Occaſional Communion</hi> with his <hi>Church</hi> too; but yet that all their fair ſhews and pretences ſhall not ſerve their turn in that day, when the workers of iniquity ſhall be caſt everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly from his preſence. Thus alſo when he ſaith <hi>Apocal.</hi> 3. 20. Behold I ſtand at

the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, <hi>and will ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> his meaning is, that he will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtricteſt <hi>League,</hi> and ingage in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable <hi>Contract</hi> of Love and Friendſhip with every obedient heart. For thoſe vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar expreſſions are no other then Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions to vulgar Capacities. Becauſe ſuch actions were reputed by all Mankind to be Symbols of Peace, and arguments of good will, therefore our Saviour choſe to expreſs his divine Philanthropy after that manner; and when Divines do accomodate ſuch expreſſions to the buſineſs of the Holy Sacrament, they go upon this ground, becauſe this religious eating and drinking is a feaſting with God now (as it was in the days of old) in a <hi>Foederal</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> way.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer and the more particular upon this point, that I might make every thing intelligible as I go along, and withal might open the ſenſe of ſome places of Scripture, which otherwiſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo rightly underſtood. Now from theſe premiſes there are two things which I ſhall conclude by way of application.</p>
               <p>6. Firſt, that men ought to come to the Bleſſed Sacrament upon great <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and with all imaginable <hi>Sincerity.</hi> We had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59160:44"/>
need be ſerious when we have to do with God; and never more than when we intend to approach before Gods Altar, leſt by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it after a raſh and inconſiderate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we take a large ſtep towards our own deſtruction. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God; and be more ready to hear</hi> (or obey) <hi>than to give the Sacrifice of Fools; for they conſider not that they do evil,</hi> ſaith the Royal Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1. For the Sacrifice of the wicked is abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? Saith the ſame <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Pro.</hi> 21. 27. 'Tis enough to ſtrike the heart even of an Infidel through with trembling and horrour, to conſider that people profeſſing ſo much ſanctity and zeal, ſhould dare to be ſuch audacious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as to uſe an Ordinance of ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and importance, only to make a ſhew of Religion, or to comply with a cuſtome, or to evade the Law, or to ſerve a preſent turn, or to ſecure their temporal intereſt, or to palliate a deſign, or to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour over a wicked <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or to promote the ends of an execrable <hi>Aſſociation</hi> and <hi>Confederacy.</hi> A greater affront cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be offer'd to the Majeſty of a juſt God, nor can Religion receive a greater ſcandal and blow, than when men preſume to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Chriſts own Ordinance, as a <hi>Property</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59160:45"/>
and <hi>Tool,</hi> to bring about ſuch low, ſuch baſe, ſuch abominable purpoſes. And yet how many have we ſeen, who ſeldome or never would communicate with us, but when their mony was at ſtake, and when the hand of Government lay ſomewhat heavy upon them? And have not all ſober and indifferent men reaſon to miſtruſt, that ſuch perſons come to the Holy Sacrament, not out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or any true fear of God, but rather out of pure Love of the world, out of a dogged ſort of ſullenneſs, out of ſpight to the Magiſtrate, and the Laws, with recoyling and ſelf-condemning minds, and with this irreligious and <hi>Atheſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> principle, that if they were left alone to <hi>themſelves,</hi> they would not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a thing of that Nature? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch as are concern'd to ask their Conſciences, whether this be not their caſe? And to conſider, how they will anſwer it to the Judge of all the earth, for profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Holy name, for debauching his Holy Ordinances, and for polluting his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary and the ſervice thereof, after ſuch a lewd and Abominable manner? This is to be lyable to that dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion in Pſal. 50. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt take</hi> (the ſeals of) <hi>my Covenant in thy mouth?</hi> For it is a Foederal Myſtery which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59160:45"/>
the Church here Celebrates (as I have ſhew'd you;) every Communicant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Covenant with God by this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whether it be truth or a Lie that is in their right hand, they take the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it; and they certainly contract with him, either for a bleſſing, or for a Curſe. So that there is no Trifling with the Majeſty of Heaven (for God will not be mocked, eſpecially after ſuch a <hi>Solemn</hi> rate) there is no colluding with Angels, and men, and our own ſouls, eſpecially in a thing of ſuch vaſt <hi>Importance</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</hi> It is a very memorable ſtory which the eminent Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> tells us (in his Appeal for Proteſtants) of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59160:46"/>
You ſee it is an old <hi>Popiſh</hi> courſe, for men to go to Gods Table only to <hi>Qualifie</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, only to ſerve their <hi>Secular</hi> intereſt, and to ſeem to make a Covenant with God, when they have made a Covenant with Hell. But (though God doth not make <hi>viſible</hi> examples of <hi>all</hi> ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Hypocrites, yet) we have as much reaſon to believe that God is angry with them, as we are certain that he is angry with every <hi>Rebel,</hi> though he doth not preſently deſtroy him in that manner as he deſtroy'd <hi>Korah.</hi> It is a deſperate thing for any man to dally with the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient and righteous God; and very dangerous to be raſh and heedleſs in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Contract,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts as are for an <hi>Eternity.</hi> Men uſe to be careful how they ſet their hands to a <hi>Bond,</hi> And to conſider things throughly before they ſeal inſtruments of Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And by how much a <hi>Soul</hi> is more valuable than <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſo much the more is every one obliged to deal wiſely and faithfully with his Soul, when he brings it under engagements. The raſh taking of <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> hath ſent more Souls to the Devil, than a Civil War hath ſent men to their Graves, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary therefore to be well advis'd in actions which are look't upon to be of a <hi>Binding</hi>

nature, and eſpecially when we come to the Holy Sacrament, which lays a ſtrict and indefeiſable obligation upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

This was ſhameful diſſimulation and baſe perfidiouſneſs: But their Sin is infinitely greater, who come to the Sacrament pretending they are deſirous to enter into Covenant with the Prince of Peace, but are no other than <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Counterfeits</hi> in all this, full of deceitfulneſs and hypocriſie in the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being as ready to <hi>Betray</hi> Chriſt, as they ſeem ready to <hi>Kiſs</hi> him. Therefore men ſhould be very ſerious and without all

guile, when they make their addreſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and be afraid ofnothing more, than of putting tricks upon Heaven, when they think to deceive the world; becauſe all ſuch hypocriſie is both an argument of reprobate minds, and moreover an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe that Hypocrites take to ſeal themſelves up to everlaſting perdition.</p>
               <p>2. And ſo it is alſo, when men wilfully <hi>Forſake</hi> the Covenant of God, after they have ſolemnly undertaken it. In the next place therefore, we ſhould be very careful, as to <hi>Contract</hi> at Gods Table with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſo to <hi>ſtand reſolutely</hi> to what we have done, and to <hi>Perform</hi> our Vows, promiſes, and obligations, with conſtancy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs afterwards. When a Covenant is evil, either in the whole or in part (as ſome <hi>Solemn Leagues and Covenants</hi> have been in a very high degree) then it becomes null and void of it ſelf, and 'tis a Sin, not to <hi>break</hi> but to <hi>Keep</hi> it. But where a Covenant is both lawful and neceſſary (as the vowing of univerſal Chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the <hi>Holy</hi> Sacrament is) there if men flinch from their Duty, and willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw back, the Crime is of ſuch a high nature, that <hi>Gods Soul will have no pleaſure</hi> in ſuch Apoſtates, <hi>Heb</hi> 10. 38.

Which expreſſions are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically applicable to the ſin I now ſpeak of, the ſin of <hi>Unfaithfulneſs,</hi> after we have participated of Chriſt, after we have drank of his blood; this is indeed to deſpiſe the Son of God as one of no value; and to trample upon his blood, as an unprofitable, as a contemptible, as a vile thing; and of what ſore puniſhments ſhall not ſuch be thought worthy? It was an old cuſtome among ſome people to make Covenants by giving and taking a little quantity of Wool which they had ſhorn<note place="margin">—Quibus foederibus qui contrairet, turpiſſimo facinore, &amp; in expiabili ſcelere tenebatur. <hi>Alex.</hi> ab <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> ubi ſupra.</note> from the top of a Lambs Head; and they who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſuch Covenants, were

               <argument>
                  <p>A third end of this Sacrament is to engage us to obſerve the Laws of that Religion to which it doth belong. Proved from the Notion of the new Covenant: From the deſign of Myſteries in general: From its Analogy to Myſtical Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets in particular both among <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> eſpecially the Paſchal-Supper. The ſenſe of the Church touching this matter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO proceed now to another end of this Sacrament: It being already demonſtrated that this Myſtery was inſtituted as a <hi>Foederal,</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> Rite to be uſed under the Goſpel, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that a <hi>Third</hi> End of it is to engage all ſuch as uſe it to the ſtrict obſervation of that Religion which is eſtabliſht by the Goſpel. This will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, if we conſider well theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59160:49"/>
three things. 1. If we conſider only the Nature and Notion of the Evangelical Covenant to which this Myſtery doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. 2. If we conſider beſides, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, an Importance of all Myſtical Rites in <hi>general.</hi> 3. If we conſider alſo the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy which this Rite beareth to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Myſtical Banquets in <hi>particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to the Firſt of theſe; the Nature and Notion of a Covenant is this, that it is a Pact, Contract, or agreement, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certain Conditions and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> for the performance whereof each party bindeth himſelf, and undertaketh to the other. And the Evangelical Covenant is a Pact of this nature: For as it containeth promiſes which it lyeth on <hi>Gods</hi> part to make good; as that he will pardon our ſins in this world, and take ſuch care of our Souls and Bodies, that we ſhall be everlaſtingly happy in the next World; ſo it contains certain <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> and terms, which it lyes on <hi>Our</hi> part to perform in order thereunto; as that we will believe on his Son whom he ſent into the World to be our Propitiation, that we will ſincerely repent of all the miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we have committed, and that we will make it our care and buſineſs to lead a Life of Vertue and Holineſs, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Seeing then that this is the Covenant that is between God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59160:50"/>
and us now; ſeeing that this Myſtery was appointed <hi>purſuant</hi> to this Covenant; and ſeeing that at the due Celebration of it the Covenant is <hi>Ratified</hi> and confirmed; it muſt undeniably follow (whatever the <hi>Socinians</hi> and others affirm to the contrary) that by this Sacred Rite God himſelf is ſuppoſed to Seal his part of the Covenant unto us, and moreover that we are ſuppoſed to Seal <hi>Our</hi> part of the Covenant unto him; I mean, we are underſtood hereby <hi>viſibly</hi> to profeſs, engage and ſtipulate, that we <hi>do</hi> and <hi>will</hi> ſtedfaſtly believe, heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and by the help of Gods Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly reſolve to lead our lives ſo, as the Laws of Chriſt's Religion do require us. If it be a <hi>Foederal</hi> rite (as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved) this muſt be the deſign and meaning of it in ſhort.</p>
               <p>2. But beſides this we are to obſerve in the ſecond place, that all thoſe Myſtical Rites, which ever were uſed in the World by any Sect or Society of men, were always deſigned to engage people to be <hi>obedient</hi> and <hi>True</hi> to that Religion, to which thoſe Rites did <hi>appertain.</hi> This I note, not as if any Religion in the World could compare with the Chriſtian Inſtitution; nor as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Myſtical Rites in the World ever were of that importance and dignity, as ours are; but only to ſhew what the general
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59160:50"/>
ſenſe of Mankind hath been, as to the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>intendments</hi> of religious Myſteries. Thoſe Myſteries which were uſed in the Infant-times of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by thoſe lewd <hi>Hereticks</hi> the Simonians, the Nicolaitans, the Valentinians, the Gnoſticks, and the reſt, they were intended by the Authors of them to ſerve the <hi>Ends,</hi> and to ſtrengthen the intereſt of their Religion, and to train up Proſelytes in Conformity to that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they were admitted into. Thoſe Myſteries that were uſed of old by <hi>Pagans,</hi> as their Waſhings, their Luſtrations, their Sacrifices, their Sacrifical Banquets, their many ſorts of Feſtivals, and the like, they were deſigned to no other purpoſe, but to keep men <hi>Pagans,</hi> and to promote Paganiſm. The rites that were anciently obſerved by the Egyptians, by the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and other <hi>Greeks,</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by other Nations, what were they for, but to oblige people to be <hi>True</hi> to the gods of the Country? In like manner thoſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which God himſelf appointed under the <hi>Law,</hi> were intended by him to <hi>tye</hi> his people faſt to himſelf, and to keep them cloſe to the Obſervation of that Religion, which he had directed by his Servant <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were ſo in love with ſuperſtition and Idolatry (having lived ſo long among the <hi>Egyptians</hi>)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59160:51"/>

due obſervance of his own Religion, and that he might lay upon them the ſtricteſt Engagements to be conſtant and faithful to the Laws, which he had Eſtabliſht in his Covenant with them. For it hath been the general ſenſe and opinion of Mankind, that the religious uſing of Sacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was a <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>Solemn</hi> way of <hi>Addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Devoting</hi> themſelves to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which thoſe Myſteries did relate; that the communicating in ſuch Myſteries was of an Obligatory nature like a Vow; that it was a <hi>Conſecrating</hi> act, by vertue whereof they thought themſelves bound, in the conſtruction of Conſcience, to ſtick faſt to that Religion which they undertook, and into which they were initiated after ſuch a Solemn manner. Hence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of that <hi>Legal Foederal</hi> Rite; whereby men were initiated into the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>I teſtifie to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtour to do the whole Law.</hi> The voluntary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſuſception of that Rite, the being matriculated into the Jewiſh Church by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, did tacitly bring upon the man a burden, and Obligation, ſo that he ſtood Bound to obſerve the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to Worſhip God after the Moſaical manner, as much as if he had with his own mouth vowed and ſtipulated to do ſo at

Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The <hi>Sccinians</hi> themſelves underſtand thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe, <q>whoſoever is Circumciſed, as <hi>Moſes</hi> Diſciple, by vertue of that action of his, is bound to keep the whole Law: For he<note place="margin">

Beſides, Circumciſion is the ſign and mark of the whole Jewiſh Religion which the Law preſcribeth; ſo that by undertaking that, men oblige and tye themſelves, to the Law, as it were by a Pledge; even as Baptiſm underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the name of Chriſt, and the uſe of the Lords Supper is (ſaith <hi>Crellius</hi>) a Note and Symbol of Chriſtianity.</q> Here the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſeem unawares to make an argument againſt themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs upon the point, that the Euchariſt is not only a Commemorative, but a Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Myſtery to, that it carryeth an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on along with it, and that it is in the Nature of a Pledge. And the truth is, as men did formerly Plight their Troth to God by the right of Circumciſion, ſo do we now Plight our Troth to Chriſt by the uſe of both his Sacraments: They are binding Myſteries; and for that reaſon, I ſuppoſe, our Saviour made the uſe of Baptiſm, and the Rite of Eating and Drinking, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59160:52"/>
becauſe they were myſteries which were well known to the World, and which were known both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> to be engaging and Conſecrating myſteries. For (as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Grot. <hi>in</hi> Math. 28. 19.</note> hath rightly obſerved) <q>a Church being then to be congregated and gather'd out of all Nations, it was convenient that they ſhould have ſome Note (or mark) of their confeſſion, the ſignification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be perſpicuous and clear to all men.</q> By this means Chriſts Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the more eaſie, the more acceptable, and the more obvious both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For they were wont to Baptize too after a Sacred manner; they were wont to eat Bread and to drink Wine too in their Temples, and places of Publick Worſhip: And things being thus, as they plainly ſaw, that Chriſt Adapted theſe old myſteries to his own Inſtitution, ſo they could eaſily gather from their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, how that the great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and difference lay here, that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended theſe ancient Rites to new, and to better purpoſes; that is, to tye and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, to be true to their Profeſſion, and carefully to obſerve the Laws of that Religion, of which theſe myſteries were now made a Part.</p>
               <p>3. Thus the purport and meaning of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59160:53"/>
Sacred Rites in general, ſerveth to ſhew that obliging force which we attribute to this Chriſtian Myſtery. But if we purſue the thing a little further, we ſhall find, in the Third place, more evidence of this matter ſtill, by obſerving a little that Analogy which this Chriſtian Rite beareth to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient myſtical Banquets in particular.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59160:54"/>
and Chriſt himſelf to his laſt Gaſp.</p>
               <p>By this we ſee, that the very Pagan ſort of mankind thought they very obliged by receiving the Symbols of their Religion to cleave and addict themſelves to it, and to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe engagements, which by thoſe viſible expreſſions and tokens, they made unto their Gods.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe who Worſhipped the true God after his own way, it is plain, that by Feaſting upon part of their Sacrifices they Profeſt themſelves to be <hi>his People,</hi> to whom they had offer'd up thoſe Sacrifices; and they <hi>Bound</hi> themſelves by that Sacred Rite to keep their Faith with him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſt in their Duty to him: becauſe that manner of Feaſting in the preſence of God was eſteem'd (as I have ſhew'd) a <hi>Covenant</hi>-Ceremony. For our better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this matter we muſt note, that in the Firſt Ages of the world good men were not contented with the inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Heart onely;</hi> nor did they think it enough for them to Expreſs their Devotion by <hi>words</hi> alone. No; their Zeal did excite them to give all <hi>Real,</hi> all <hi>Publick,</hi> all <hi>Viſible</hi> demonſtrations of their Love and Duty to that Supreme Being, who by the variety of this own great Works had given <hi>Plain, Real,</hi> and <hi>Viſible</hi> demonſtrations of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59160:54"/>
his Goodneſs to them. As the Egyptians were wont to expreſs things by Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks, ſo the Fathers of old were wont to expreſs their Devotion by Actions. This, I conceive, was the firſt Original of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> which we find to have been offered even by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> For conſidering that God was the Cauſe of all<note place="margin">Non ullo dei juſſu. ſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctante ratione honorem deo etiam conſpicuum habend um &amp;c. <hi>Grotius</hi> de <hi>Cain &amp; Abel</hi> in <hi>Gen. 4. 3.</hi> In quem locum vide &amp; S. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi>

               <p>The Holy Patriarchs thought this offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Sacrifices, a <hi>Becoming,</hi> becauſe an ocular Act of Divine Worſhip; an <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Solemn</hi> way of Adoreing their Creator; ſo that every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was eſteemed a <hi>Real Prayer,</hi> and every Holocauſt was accounted a Viſible <hi>Doxology.</hi> Was the Glory of Gods Majeſtie to be ſet forth, and his Greatneſs to be Publiſht? why, a <hi>whole Burn't-offering</hi> was preſently devoted for that purpoſe. Was his wrath to be deprecated, and an Atonement to be made? why, a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59160:55"/>
ſent unto his Altar? was his Mercy to be Praiſed, and the Continuauce of it to be Implored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why, a <hi>Peace offering</hi> was preſently ſet apart for his ſervice. Such was the Simplicity and Zeal of men in thoſe days, that they thought themſelves obliged to give the moſt <hi>Plain,</hi> the moſt <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> demonſtrations of their Piety. And as all their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> were, ſo were their <hi>Vows</hi> too, not <hi>Verbal</hi> onely, but <hi>Real,</hi> and <hi>Conſpicuous.</hi> Part of their Oblations they committed to the Fire to Honour their Creator, and part they fed upon themſelves to teſtifie their own Obedience. From the Altar, where they had offered up Gods <hi>Creatures,</hi> they went to the Table, to offer up <hi>Themſelves,</hi> a Living Sacrifice unto God. Their Actions were more <hi>Significant,</hi> though more <hi>Silent</hi> Expreſſions than their words. For by eating of Gods meat, they declared to the world, that they were and would be Gods Vaſſals. As <hi>Friends</hi> Pledge mutual Fidelity by Feaſting together; as a <hi>Bride</hi> Profeſſeth her Subjection and Troth to her Husband by eating of a Cake; and as <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> declare their Relation and obligations to their Maſter by feeding conſtantly at his Table; ſo did the Saints of old own their Engagements and Duty to God, by partaking of his Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>When Jews and Proſelytes feaſted upon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59160:55"/>
a Sacrificed <hi>Lamb</hi> at the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> they did by that Action Engage their Services to God according to that way of worſhip with was eſtabliſht then. For this Reaſon it was that no <hi>Uncircumciſed</hi> Perſons could be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants at that Banquet, becauſe they were out of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo could not be <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> capable of <hi>Sealing</hi> that Covenant with God, which they had not <hi>Undertaken,</hi> or <hi>entred</hi> into. They who were the Children of faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> had indeed a <hi>Right</hi> to participate; but yet the Myſtery was ſuch, as that it did call upon them to anſwer the <hi>Ends</hi> of that Covenant, which they were intereſſed in. The careful purging of all <hi>Leaven</hi> out of their houſes, did put them in mind of that <hi>inward</hi> Purity and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Heart,</hi> which the Covenant, of God did require. The Sight of a Sacrificed roaſted Lamb, did teach them to believe in the Meſſiah that was to be ſlain for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from ſin and Eternal Death. The <hi>Haggada</hi> (I ſpake of before) or the Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Publiſhing the Hiſtory of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhew'd them the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of thoſe particular Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to God, which the whole Nation of the Jews did lye under.

               <p>Thus the celebration of the Paſſeover-Supper<note place="margin">

In like manner, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is a <hi>Tye</hi> upon <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thereby we profeſs Univerſal Obedience to the <hi>Evangelical Inſtitution.</hi> Hence we may ſuppoſe it was, that the uſe of the Paſchal-Solemnity thenceſorth <hi>ceaſed</hi> utterly and for ever, ſo that not ſo much
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59160:56"/>
as that <hi>Comemorative</hi> Paſſeover was uſed any more, which the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others ſpeak of, and which conſiſted of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread and Bitter Hrebs <hi>onely.</hi> For Chriſt having fullfilled all <hi>Legal</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and having now Buryed <hi>Moſes</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably before he dyed himſelf, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inſtituted another Rite, thereby Signifying, that now all obligations of obedience to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion ceaſed. and that his Church from that time onwards was to obſerve another way, and that this Rite was intended as an <hi>Engagement</hi> upon them to do ſo. For though or Saviour did not tell his Diſciples ſo much in <hi>Expreſs</hi> terms, yet we may be eaſily ſatisfied that this was part of his meaning, if we carefully obſerve theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. If we obſerve the <hi>Analogy</hi> of this Feaſt (the thing which I have Laboured to clear as the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of theſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.) For it plainly anſwers thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Feaſts, which were uſed by Mankind in general; and it chiefly anſwers the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Feaſt, which was uſed by the Jews in Particular. Now ſince <hi>That,</hi> and the Reſt were <hi>Covenant</hi>-Banquets, that laid <hi>Tyes</hi> and <hi>obligations</hi> upon all ſuch as did obſerve them, it is reaſonable to conclude, that this Chriſtian Banquet is a <hi>Faederal</hi> Solemnity, that Layeth <hi>Tyes</hi> and Obligations upon the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59160:57"/>
Obſervers of it alſo: as it is Analogous to the Like Banquets in its <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo we muſt Suppoſe it to be Analogous in its uſe and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification</hi> likewiſe.</p>
               <p>2. We may obſerve too, that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted this Rite preſently after he had waſhed the feet of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.<note place="margin">Servitia aequè ac Proſelyti ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris imtiabantur, faeminae Loti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one; mares autem circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one pariter &amp; Lotime. <hi>Lud. de veil. in Moſen Maiemond. de Sac. paſchali pag. 6. 28.</hi>
                  </note> It was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>initiate</hi> Strangers into their Religion (not only Women, but Men alſo though they were Circumciſed) by <hi>waſhing</hi> their Bodies with Water: and that Abſolution was an <hi>Engagement</hi> upon them to obſerve the Religion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Our Bleſſed Lord being willing to make the beſt uſe of thoſe cuſtomes which others u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and underſtood, did not only order his Diſciples to initiate <hi>Proſelytes</hi> by <hi>waſhing</hi> them likewiſe, but he did it <hi>Himſelf</hi> now. Though he did not Baptize any as <hi>John</hi> did, by waſhing all their Bodies in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet he waſhed his Diſciples <hi>Feet,</hi> which was <hi>Tantamount.</hi> And thereby he did not only ſet before them a wonderful pattern of <hi>Humility</hi> by that humble mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his own, but he did alſo after a <hi>Ritual</hi> manner formally <hi>admit</hi> them into that Religion, which he had inſtructed them in before; and by that Ceremony they came to have <hi>a part in him; i. e,</hi> to have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59160:57"/>
a great <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>ſhare</hi> in him, and to be very nearly related to him, as we may gather from thoſe words of his to <hi>Peter, If I waſh thee not thou haſt no part in me, Jo.</hi> 13. 8. Now conſidering, that preſently after that action, he returned to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>again,</hi> and proceeded to the inſtitution of this <hi>Feaſt,</hi> 'tis rational to Judge that he intended it as a <hi>another Tye,</hi> and as a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obligation</hi> upon his Proſelytes, to be true to that Religion which he had now ſo Solemnly entred them into.</p>
               <p>3. We may obſerve, that the Diſciples took the Sacred Elements from Chriſts own Hands. We do not read, nor doth it Seem Probable, that our Saviour did now partake of either <hi>Himſelf;</hi> but having broken the Loaf and bleſſed the Cup, he give it to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Now as the taking of a <hi>Pledge</hi> brings a <hi>Tye</hi> and <hi>Engagement</hi> upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver (and the receiving of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was of old univerſally thought to carry the moſt <hi>Sacred</hi> obligation along with it) ſo the taking of theſe things at the Hands of Chriſt, was a Viſible Rite of <hi>Stipulating</hi> with him: hereby they undertook Solemnly to do whatever he had commanded them: hereby they give their Maſter the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Securities,</hi> that they would be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithfull</hi> to him, whatever ſhould come of it, though they ſhould even receive Death
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59160:58"/>
for it at the hands of men. The Actions which now paſt between our Lord and his Family were Rites of <hi>Covenanting,</hi> ſuch as were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed in ancient times in Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: Theſe were plain <hi>Interpreters</hi> of their minds; and they ſpake the Senſe of the Diſciples as plainly, as if they had ſaid with their <hi>Tongues,</hi> as the Jews ſaid at Mount Sinai, <hi>All that the Lord hath ſpoken, we will do and be Obedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons our Church (I am ſure) looks upon this as a <hi>Conſecrating</hi> Myſtery, by celebrating whereof every Communicant doth <hi>Devote</hi> himſelf wholly to the Service of God in Chriſt. This is manifeſtly concluded from thoſe words in the Prayer at the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenium,</hi> Here <hi>we offer and preſent unto thee, O Lord, our Selves, our Souls and Bodies to be a reaſonable, holy and Lively Sacrifice unto thee.</hi> And herein the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth perfectly agree with the Catholick Church of old, for Chriſtians in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times eſteemed this Holy Rite, as a moſt Sacred and Strict <hi>Tye</hi> upon them, that they <hi>who Live in this world ſhould no longer Live unto themſelves, but unto Him, who died and roſe again for them,</hi> as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid. And that this was the Senſe of the Ancient Church will appear by theſe 3. Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. From the ſpecial Notation and uſe of the Word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in the Latine

                  </note> were wont to call their Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Oath, <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier did, by that Sacred prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,<note place="margin">Vocati ſumus ad militam dei vivi jam tunc cum in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti verba ſpoſpondimus. <hi>Tertull,</hi> ad <hi>Martyr.</hi> Devotum Deo obſequium Euchariſtia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvit, an magis Deo obligat? <hi>id. de Oration.</hi>
                  </note> plight and Swear <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> to his General. From the <hi>Camp</hi> the word was brought into the <hi>Church,</hi> and was uſed to ſignifie thoſe two great Myſteries of our Religion, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And the reaſon of it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ancient Chriſtians did believe that by Celebrating theſe Myſteries they did ſwear <hi>Fealty</hi> to the <hi>Captain of their Salvation,</hi> and did <hi>Vow</hi> that they would <hi>manfully ſight under his Banner againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, and continue Chriſts faithful Souldiers and ſervants unto their lives end,</hi> as our Church excellently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it with alluſion to the <hi>Military Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The ſame appears, ſecondly, from the <hi>Practice</hi> of the ancient Chriſtians, who were known, even by the confeſſion of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to uſe this Sacrament to this <hi>End,</hi> that thereby they might be<note place="margin">—Se<expan>

For <hi>Pliny,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul in <hi>Aſia</hi> about ſixty years after our Lords Aſcenſion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59160:59"/>
writing to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor about the Chriſtians, gave him this account of them, that their cuſtome was upon a ſet <hi>day to meet together before Sun riſe, and to ſing Hymns to Chriſt, and to bind themſelves by a Sacrament,</hi> not for any wickedneſs, but that they would not to be guilty of any Theſts, or Robberies, or Adulteries, or be falſe to their words and promiſes, and the like.</p>
               <p>3. This plainly ſhews, that the ſenſe of the Primitive Church was, that Mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Holy Sacrament is like the taking of a <hi>Promiſſory Oath,</hi> a taking of the greateſt <hi>Tyes</hi> and <hi>Obligations</hi> upon them. And this, thirdly, we may ſuppoſe was the reaſon, why they were wont to take it <hi>every day</hi> in thoſe times. For thoſe were times of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> dangers, and death lay every day before them, and many provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations did lie in their way to tempt them unto <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> It was thought neceſſary therefore for Chriſtians then, to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>daily</hi> to the Lords Table, that their zeal for Chriſt crucified might not <hi>cool,</hi> but that it might be like the Fire of old upon God's Altar, continually <hi>Burning,</hi> and that their Obligations to all manner of active and paſſive obedience, might be every day <hi>renewed</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> by their conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59160:59"/>To conclude this conſideration therefore by making it practical. As men ought to be very <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Sincere</hi> when they go <hi>to</hi> the Holy Table, ſo ſhould they be very <hi>Circumſpect</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they depart <hi>from</hi> it, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that they have entred Solemnly into the deepeſt <hi>Engagements, and have taken</hi> Chriſts whole burden upon them. I find<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Boldacius</hi> de Oggio Chriſtiano <hi>lib. 2.</hi> c. 19.</note> a Story told out of <hi>Abulenſis</hi> concerning <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that when <hi>Potiphars</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by her Fathers command, was going about to ſalute him, <hi>Joſeph</hi> put forth his hand to keep her at a diſtance; and gave this reaſon for it, becauſe <hi>a Woman that Worſhipped Idols, that did eat the Bread and drink the Wine of Idols, ought not in any wiſe to ſclute a man, that Worſhipped the living God, and had eaten of Holy Bread.</hi> This Story indeed is granted to be a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> but yet it is of good uſe to us in two reſpects. 1. It ſhews (what I have already proved) that the <hi>Authors</hi> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of this tale, took it for granted, that the communicating of Bread and Wine, whether it was before <hi>God,</hi> or before an <hi>Idol,</hi> was a viſible Rite of <hi>Covenanting</hi> with that Deity whoſe Religion thoſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, whether they were Jews or Heathens. 2. It argues (what I am now upon) that ſuch as have <hi>Eaten</hi> and <hi>Drank</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59160:60"/>
of the true God; ought to take a moſt ſpecial care, that they <hi>defile</hi> not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with any manner of <hi>Impurity.</hi> Not that men ſhould only beware of falling into the embraces of an Egyptian <hi>Love</hi> (I would not be underſtood ſo) but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who participates of this Holy Bread and Cup, ſhould arm himſelf with a ſturdy reſolution, never to commit Willingly, that which is really <hi>Baſe</hi> and <hi>Sinful.</hi> I would crave leave to deal plainly; becauſe we live in a <hi>lewd</hi> age, and many <hi>Egyptians</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and every man hath not either the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>Courage</hi> of a <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Some have an unlucky and ill Art of <hi>ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the great Catalogue of ſins into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>little</hi> number; ſo that if they be not common <hi>Swearers,</hi> or <hi>Drunkards,</hi> or <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> they are, in their own account, the very Babes of Grace, though their Souls are as black as an <hi>Ethiope,</hi> nay as Hell it ſelf, with all <hi>other</hi> kinds of Villany.

               <p>BEſides theſe Ends already mentioned, there is another yet, for which this bleſſed Ordinance was appointed; <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be a Token and Pledge, and as it were a Seal, to aſſure every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and honeſt-hearted Communicant of the Divine Grace and<note place="margin">Sunt, qui omnino credant, caenam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini nobis teſtari Dei erga nos bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiam.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59160:62"/>
'Tis true our Saviour did not mention it in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> terms; but this is no argument againſt us, becauſe neither did he mention (that we read of) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>ſelf-examination</hi> before the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Ordinance; nor (perhaps) had we had any Scripture proof for our Duty in that particular, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not told it us <hi>occaſionally,</hi> and by chance, and by reaſon of ſome <hi>abuſes,</hi> which had crept into the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this our Duty may be gathered eaſily from the conſideration of the very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Analogy</hi> of this Chriſtian Feaſt, And ſo may our Doctrine touching this <hi>End</hi> of it alſo. For ſeeing this is a Covenant-ſolemnity (as I have ſhew'd from our Saviours own words) it is rational for us to conclude that here there is an <hi>Obſignation</hi> between <hi>both</hi> parties; as on our part, ſo on Gods part alſo. And ſeeing this Myſtery is anſwerable to other the like Myſteries of old, which were vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known over the World, it is fit for us to judge, that it was intended alſo for ſuch anſwerable <hi>Ends</hi> and purpoſes as were vulgarly known too.</p>
               <p>Indeed I do not wonder that the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians deny the <hi>vertue</hi> and efficacy of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ſeeing they deny the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and the propitiatory
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59160:63"/>
Virtue of Chriſts own blood. But we may well wonder, that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſhould have the confidence to ſay, <hi>that the blood of Beaſts formerly was far better</hi> (that is much more efficacious) <hi>in reſpect of the Old Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Socin. <hi>in</hi> diſput. contr. Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojev.</note> 
                  <hi>than this Bread and Wine now is in reſpect of the New,</hi> for though we grant (what <hi>Socinus</hi> affirms) that 'tis not the <hi>Wine,</hi> but the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> which anſwers the Blood of the ancient <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> yet ſeeing the Wine is the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> of Chriſts Blood, we muſt conclude that it Communicates thoſe benefits, for which that Blood was ſhed; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it ſeals that Covenant to every faithful Communicant in particular, which the Blood of Chriſt ſealed to all Mankind in general. And as it is true, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Paſſion did anſwer thoſe Sacrifices which were offered up of old; ſo it is true alſo, that this Holy Banquet doth anſwer thoſe Sacrifical Feaſts, which were uſed of old. If therefore it be made appear. 1. That thoſe ſacrifical Feaſts which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Celebrated by <hi>Heathens,</hi> were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as <hi>Tokens</hi> of the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> of their Idols unto them. 2. That the Sacrifical Feaſts which were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the <hi>Jews</hi> were eſteemed <hi>Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of God unto them: then it will follow of courſe,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59160:63"/>
that this Sacrifical Feaſt, which is <hi>Analogous</hi> unto thoſe, ought alſo to be eſteemed a <hi>Pledge</hi> a <hi>Token,</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> of the Friendſhip and Favour of God now unto <hi>Us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Firſt then it is evident, that the old Heathens did reckon, that their being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake of their Sacrifices, was an <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Pledge</hi> of the <hi>Favour</hi> of their ſuppoſed Deities. Hence it is that<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us, as the joynt opinion and confeſſion of all their Divines, that no man was to eat of their <hi>Piacular</hi> victims; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch Sacrifices as were offered up to avert <hi>Evils</hi> from them, and to appeaſe the wrath of their Gods. The reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sacrificers were lookt upon at that time to be in a ſtate of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> out of <hi>Favour</hi> with their Gods, and under their heavy <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not to partake of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation till their <hi>Peace</hi> was made; no, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Feaſting</hi> with their Deities, they were to be <hi>Cleanſed</hi> firſt, neither were they to go home to their Cities, or into their own houſes, till they had waſhed their Bodies and their very Clothes in ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Fountain. It was the general ſenſe even of Idolaters, that to banquet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Temples upon part of thoſe things which they had ſacrificed at their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, was a ſure <hi>Token</hi> that their Gods were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59160:64"/>
                  <hi>Friends</hi> with them. Hence it was, that after the Sacrifice they were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all manner of Mirth, chearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before their Deities, and ſetting out their <hi>Praiſes,</hi> and ſinging <hi>Hymns</hi> to them,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Alex.</hi> ab <hi>Alex. 1. 4. c. 17. &amp; Gyrald.</hi> de diis <hi>gent.

And hence they concluded rightly, that their being allowed to come to <hi>Gods Table,</hi> and to eat of <hi>Gods meat,</hi> was a clear <hi>evidence</hi> that God was at <hi>Peace</hi> with them. And <q>this (as the ſame Author tells us) was one reaſon why God ſometimes appointed his <hi>Prieſts</hi> alone to eat of the Sacrifice in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59160:65"/>
name of the <hi>Reſt,</hi> and as the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of thoſe who had offered it, that they might be aſſured, <hi>that to as many as repented of their Sins, God was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come kind and Propitious;</hi> becauſe it was<note place="margin">Id.

                  </q> I ſuppoſe he means, that the Prieſts eating the Sacrifice as the peoples <hi>Proxies,</hi> was an evident To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that God was <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> to be in perfect amity with them; and that he was ſo far reconciled to them, as to make them <hi>capable</hi> of being inſtated in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>fully.</hi> For they were not ſure, that God was <hi>perfectly</hi> Friends with them, till they were admitted to <hi>eat</hi> of their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their own <hi>perſons.</hi> Hence it was that the Prieſts alone did Eat of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi> becauſe the parties that did offer them were now under <hi>Guilt,</hi> and ſo were unfit as yet for Gods entertainment. Hence it was too, that they offered <hi>piacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> ſacrifices, before the <hi>Peace-offrings,</hi> (which they were allowed to partake of) becauſe their ſins were to be <hi>Atoned</hi> for, before they could receive the Pledges of his <hi>Love,</hi> as his Gueſts and Favourties. Hence it was alſo, that none of thoſe, who were any wiſe <hi>polluted</hi> or <hi>unclean,</hi> in

the conſtruction of the Law, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eat of any <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> or of the Paſchal Supper, becauſe they were not yet <hi>Reconciled</hi> unto the God of Purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.

Therefore God himſelf, to confirm his own people in the belief of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to make them <hi>ſure</hi> of it, that he would infallibly redeem them with a ſtrong hand, notwithſtanding all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and difficulties they ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ordered them to kill in each houſe a Lamb; and to <hi>feaſt</hi> upon it, and to be <hi>aſſured</hi> thereby, that he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deliver them, even tho the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould be never ſo enraged to ſee that <hi>Creature killed,</hi> which they thought it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> for men to ſlay and eat of; ſo that as the <hi>Rainbow</hi> was a ſign of Gods Covenant with <hi>Noah;</hi> and as <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> was a Token of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> (for ſo the Scripture calls it expreſly, not only the Seal of <hi>Abrahams righteouſneſs</hi> (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it) but a Token of Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> too with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 11.) even ſo the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover Feaſt</hi> was now a ſign and Token of his Covenant with <hi>Abrahams Children.</hi> In after ages it continued to be a Pledge ſtill of the Divine favour to them, and for that reaſon it was that no <hi>ſtranger,</hi> no uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Man, no unclean perſon could par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59160:67"/>
of it, becauſe being as yet out of Gods favour, they were uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Token,</hi> the <hi>Pledge,</hi> the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of his Love and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that the feaſting upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices was thought by all mankind to be a Pledge and argument, that Heaven was propitious to them: Seeing that the feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>peace-offerings</hi> in general, and upon the <hi>Paſchal-Lamb</hi> in particular, was concluded by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be a Pledge and argument of Gods ſpecial love to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Nations; it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that this our feaſting upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sacrifice, this our Eating of Bread <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead</hi> of his Natural Fleſh, this our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sacrifical Banquet, being <hi>Analogous</hi> and anſwerable to the Sacrifical Banquets of Old, ought alſo to be looked upon, as thoſe were, to be a Token, Pledge, and Seal of Gods favour, goodneſs, and grace to us, though the Scriptures had <hi>not</hi> told us any thing to that effect in <hi>expreſs</hi> terms.</p>
               <p>But in my opinion St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to this purpoſe, if men will but atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively liſten to what he ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where part of his buſineſs is to ſhew, how unlawful it is for Chriſtians to Eat of things that are offered unto Idols. And this he doth by ſhewing the <hi>incongruity</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> of the thing, and the Evil
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59160:67"/>
                  <hi>effects</hi> of it; becauſe every profeſſor of Chriſtianity doth hereby make himſelf a moſt wretched <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> and <hi>undoes</hi> all his intereſt in Chriſt, and throws away an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable ſtock and Treaſure of Bleſſings, by his ſitting at meat in the Idols Temple. To make this out he ſhews in few words what thoſe Bleſſings are, <hi>The Cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Though ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> interpret thoſe words, as if by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Body and blood, was meant, the making and cauſing us to be of that Society (or Church) which belongs to Chriſts Body and Blood (which is a very Triſſing and far fetch interpretation) as <hi>Slichtingius</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. Yet in the <hi>Socinian</hi> Catechiſm, they own and confeſs, that ſuch as ducly Celebrate this Rite, do Communicate of Chriſts Body and Blood that is (ſay they) of all thoſe good things which Chriſt hath brought tous by his Death; though they trifle again in ſaying, that this Rite is not any cauſe; but only an Atteſtation of that Communion.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> ver. 16. were part of the Apoſtles meaning is this, that by rightly receiving the Symbols of Chriſts Body and Blood, we have a <hi>ſhare</hi> in all thoſe Bleſſings for which his Body was broken, and his Blood was ſhed: We have a <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Claim,</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> thereby to all the Mercies of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; we receive the Vertues and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects of his Paſſion, and ſo we are underſtood in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of Chriſts Body and Blood. 'Tis true; we do here partake of Chriſt not <hi>myſtically</hi> only, but <hi>really</hi> too; we parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59160:68"/>
not only of his <hi>Bruiſed</hi> and <hi>Crucified,</hi> but alſo of his moſt <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Glorified</hi> Body, as I ſhall ſhew at large hereafter in its proper place: But that is not to our purpoſe now. Though we do Communicate of Chriſt now, while he is in Heaven, yet in the place before quoted, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth directly point to thoſe bleſſings, which by means of this Sacrament accrue to us from his <hi>ſufferings</hi> on the <hi>Croſs.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that we do hereby receive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch bleſſings; and that we are <hi>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled</hi> to the Love and favour of God in particular (which is the <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of all other bleſſings, to convince us of this, I ſay) he draws a <hi>parallel</hi> between this ſacrifical feaſt of <hi>Ours,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were uſed among the <hi>Jews. Behold</hi> Iſrael <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> ſaith he: Are not they which Eat <hi>of the ſacrifices, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Clarius <hi>in</hi> Loc.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Altar?</hi> that is, do they not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Vertue</hi> of thoſe Sacrifices which are offered upon the Altar? His plain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did partake of thoſe <hi>effects,</hi> which by the Sacrifices were procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; their feaſting upon the Sacrifices was a <hi>Token</hi> and <hi>Pledge</hi> to them, that their deſires were <hi>anſwered;</hi> that what they had offered and ſacrificed for, was <hi>granted</hi> them; that their oblations returned into their own boſome, that they had the <hi>Benefit</hi> of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59160:68"/>
them, and were entitled to thoſe bleſſings which they were intended for. There is an expreſſion which will make this matter clear, in <hi>Lev. 7. 18. If any of the Fleſh of the ſacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it ſhall not be accepted? neither ſhall it be imputed unto him that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.</hi> When thoſe ſacrifical Feaſts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Celebrated, they were <hi>imputed</hi> to the gueſts for their <hi>Good,</hi> they were <hi>recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> advantagious to them, they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably <hi>accepted</hi> at Gods hand in order to the Ends for which the Sacrifice was deſigned, they ſerved to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were effectual to their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they were good to all intents, they were <hi>available</hi> to the Offerers; (as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aynſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth. <hi>in</hi> Lev. 7. 18.</note> Doctors expound the Phraſe.) This is the true meaning of being <hi>Partakers of the Altar,</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Language; when by eating duely of the Sacrifices of the Altar, they turned to a good <hi>Account,</hi> and Men were <hi>Profited, Benefited,</hi> and <hi>Bleſt</hi> by ſo doing, being in Communion with God, whoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar it was, and receiving the Pledges of his favour, which was obtained by the things that were offered upon the Altar. Was the Grace of God to be beg'd and ſought for by an <hi>Holocauſt?</hi> why, eating of the Oblations, which were <hi>annext</hi> to it was a Pledge to aſſure them, that their Prayer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59160:69"/>
was heard, and that God would be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them? Was the Wrath of God to be appeaſed by a <hi>ſin-offering?</hi> Why, the feeding upon thoſe oblations, which <hi>attended</hi> it, was appointed as a Pledge to certifie them, that an Atonement was made. Were <hi>peace-offerings</hi> preſented, that people might be delivered from dangers and ill changes, and that God would give them Peace, Proſperity, and Plenty, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his goodneſs to them? Why, the <hi>Feaſting</hi> upon the Peace offerings was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a <hi>Pledge</hi> to ſatisfie them, that Gods good providence and care of them ſhould not be wanting, as long as they would not be wanting to themſelves. Thus they were partakers of the Altar, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured of the <hi>effects</hi> of their offerings.</p>
               <p>To return now to our Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>As the Jews were</hi> partakers of Gods <hi>Altar,</hi> ſo are we partakers of the Lords <hi>Table.</hi> Their ſacrifical feaſts were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as Pledges of Gods manifold mercies to <hi>them:</hi> And this Chriſtian feaſt is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Pledg of Gods manifold Mercies to <hi>us,</hi> but to <hi>better</hi> purpoſes, and in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>degree.</hi> God Covenanted with them for things <hi>temporal;</hi> with us he Covenants for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> things chiefly. Chriſt our Sacrifice was ſlain, to purge our very Conſciences from ſin, to endue us with the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59160:69"/>
Holy Ghoſt, and with power from on high, to deliver us from the danger of Eternal Damnation, to make us ſure of Heaven, and to make God and us, one. And this our ſacrifical Feaſt is intended as a <hi>Pledge</hi> to <hi>certifie</hi> and <hi>aſſure</hi> us, that his friendſhip and deareſt love ſhall never fail us, if we be but true friends to our own Souls. Thus we partake and Communicate of our Saviours Body that was <hi>Crucified,</hi> and of the ſtreams of that Blood he ſhed for us, by receiving at this Sacrament the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> received the Vertues and <hi>effects</hi> of their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> This Sacrament is a Token to us, that Chriſts Sacrifice is <hi>imputed</hi> to us (in a comfortable ſenſe) that is, here God aſſures all faithful Communicants, and as it were ſets his Seal to it, that Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up himſelf ſhall infallibly turn to a good <hi>account</hi> to them, that it is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>Atonement</hi> on their behalf; that it ſhall be <hi>available</hi> for them to all intents and purpoſes; and that tho' they do not eat of the very <hi>fleſh</hi> of our <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of their <hi>Peace-oflerings,</hi> but of Bread in the <hi>Room</hi> of it, yet it ſhall be all one to them <hi>in effect,</hi> and that they ſhall ever be the Bleſſed of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I have been the more prolix and exact in this matter, that I might clear and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate

the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In her Catechiſm.</note> whoſe Notion of a Sacrament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is this, that it is an outward and viſible <hi>ſign</hi> ordained as a <hi>means</hi> whereby we <hi>receive,</hi> and as a <hi>pledge</hi> to <hi>aſſure</hi> us of an inward and ſpiritual grace.

               <p>1. To draw down this ſpeculation now to our Chriſtian Practice.

at hand to palliate their ſinful negligence? How do they <hi>mutter</hi> and <hi>complain,</hi> if the Law threaten them with ſtripes for their diſobedience? And how do they think themſelves no leſs than <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> if the Magiſtrate finds it neceſſary to <hi>conſtrain</hi> them do their Duty, when <hi>perſwaſions</hi> will not work upon them?

they, would you have us eat and drink our own damnation? No, the Lord forbid it, but we would have you ſincerely <hi>Repent</hi> that you may be ſaved.

               <p>But indeed there would be little need of theſe Argumentations, but that it is the

                  <hi>Divels</hi> great work, and he uſeth his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wiles, above all things to keep men from the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> leſt they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there the <hi>Seals</hi> of Gods everlaſting <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and not come into the ſame Condemnation with Himſelf, and with the damned Aſſociation in <hi>Hell.</hi> Hence it is, that he ſuggeſteth to ſome, that it is an <hi>Uſeleſs</hi> Ordinance, or not of ſuch moment as to be <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> to others, that they ſhall have Time enough, and will be fitter for it <hi>Hereafter;</hi> to others, that it is <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to celebrate it <hi>Rightly;</hi> to others, that it is a <hi>Formidable</hi> and <hi>Dangerous</hi> Myſtery; and to others, that when they have done what they are required, little <hi>Profit</hi> comes by it, unleſs it be the Saving of their Money. But were not the Ignorance of men ſo Great, and their Prejudices ſo Strong, as that they do not ſee or obſerve the <hi>Meaning</hi> of this Rite, theſe <hi>Fancies</hi> (for ſo I call them) would Preſently <hi>Vaniſh.</hi> For one deſign of it is to <hi>Engage</hi> us to be Really and Sincerely <hi>Good;</hi> and another end of it is, to <hi>Aſſure</hi> us, that as long as we are ſo, we have a good <hi>Title</hi> to the Felicities which are above, ſo that let men be conſcious to themſelves, that they have Honeſt and Good Hearts towards God and towards Men, and they may be ſo far from looking upon this as a Dreadful

diſcouraging or empty Myſtery, that they ought to look upon it as upon the moſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi> Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt: Becauſe it is intended to be a Sacrifical Feaſt, that by means thereof we may participate of the <hi>Great oblation</hi> made once for all upon the Croſs (that is, of the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of that oblation) and may receive a <hi>ſure Pledge</hi> at the hands of God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are in a bleſſed ſtate of Salvation.</p>
               <p>2. In an humble and modeſt confidence of this, ſecondly, every Devout and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted Communicant may go away with an <hi>eaſie</hi> and chearful mind, and with this comfortable perſwaſion, that he ſtands fair in the Eye of God, and that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is <hi>ſafe,</hi> if he be but careful to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere</hi> unto the end in well-doing. I do not love to blow Men up with Air, nay I think it a great miſcarriage and ſin in ſome Teachers of our days, that they are given very much to <hi>puff up</hi> their Diſciples with a huge conceit of themſelves and of their State, and make poor ignorant, (nay ill) people to believe, that they are the <hi>precious Veſſels of Election,</hi> and the greateſt Saints, when they have little but their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and ſome <hi>Cant,</hi> that beſpeaks them Chriſtians. It is not for any of us to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize thoſe who ſtand yet upon the earth, eſpecially if their feet be foul, and their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59160:73"/>
ways crooked. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> firſt into the Mire, and at laſt into Tophet. It is not for any man to <hi>preſume,</hi> ſo as to put it out of all <hi>queſtion</hi> and <hi>doubt;</hi> but yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Good Man hath reaſon to <hi>Hope,</hi> ſo as not to be <hi>perplext</hi> and <hi>diſtracted</hi> in his mind, touching the <hi>certainty</hi> of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt affections to him. And of all others, the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>honeſt-hearted Communicant</hi> hath the <hi>greateſt</hi> reaſon to hope, that he ſhall one day ſee the goodneſs of God in the Land of the living; becauſe that part of the New Covenant which containeth Gods promiſes, is <hi>confirmed</hi> at this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every Holy Soul. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Covenant of Grace was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, and therefore his Blood is called; <hi>the blood of the Covenant;</hi> that is, of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was <hi>Sealed</hi> and ratified to us by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Blood, as the <hi>old</hi> Covenant was confirmed, ratified, and ſealed to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Blood of <hi>Beaſts.</hi> But then it is to be conſidered, that the Covenant was confirmed upon the Croſs to all <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,</hi> not to me, or to <hi>thee</hi> in <hi>particular</hi> (for no man finds himſelf named in Gods promiſe) but to all Believers in <hi>general.</hi> Now as it was neceſſary, that the Divine Grace ſhould be firſt <hi>purchaſed</hi> for all at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59160:73"/>
                  <hi>large,</hi> and then ſome means uſed for the <hi>conveyance</hi> of this purchaſe to every <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> Believer; ſo is it neceſſary, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi> the confirmation and ſealing of the promiſes by Chriſts <hi>Death</hi> to all in general there ſhould be <hi>another</hi> obſignation to the Soul of every perſon in <hi>particular,</hi> that gives up himſelf to him that died for him; becauſe otherwiſe every ones mind would fluctuate in endleſs <hi>doubtings,</hi> and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties. Now we ſay, that <hi>this</hi> obſignation is tranſacted at this <hi>Covenant-Feaſt:</hi> And how ſo? Why, here every <hi>particular</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant that is duly prepared, receives the <hi>Seal,</hi> when he receives the <hi>Elements,</hi> which are the <hi>Tokens</hi> and <hi>Pledges</hi> upon the Divine favour. In that I am admitted to participate here of the Sacrifice of the Croſs, it is an evident ſign and ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, that that Sacrifice ſhall be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> to me, ſhall be available and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual for me; as the Sacrifice was <hi>imputed</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was available and effectual for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was <hi>declared</hi> to be ſo, when they were admitted to partake of the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and to feaſt upon them, as we do here upon Bread and Wine.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the bleſſings we receive by a due uſe of this Ordinance. Firſt, we Myſtically participate of Chriſts Body and Blood. What that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical participation is. Secondly, that we receive the Pardon of Sin. Proved from the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this Feaſt to the Ancient Sacrifical Banquets in general: And from its Analogy to thoſe Feaſts which were uſed after Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings in particular; and from the words of Chriſt at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus diſcourſed of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of this Sacrament, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed next according to the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to diſcourſe of the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> which it brings us, by our due Reception of it.</p>
               <p>1. And, firſt, it is the joynt Confeſſion of all the Chriſtian <hi>Churches</hi> in the world
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59160:74"/>
(for I do not reckon upon the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Socinians</hi>) that we do hereby receive the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Redeemer. This I mention in the firſt place, and muſt take the greater care and pains to clear, becauſe the proof hereof will ſtrongly and evidently prove the conveyance of divers <hi>other</hi> bleſſings hereafter to be mentioned in their order. Now we are ſaid to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſts Body and Blood in a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> ſenſe; that is, after a <hi>Myſtical,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>real</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>1. In a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe we do partake here of our Saviours Body, as it was <hi>Broken,</hi> and of his Blood as it was <hi>ſhed</hi> for us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs: that is, our Feaſting together at the Holy Table; is by <hi>interpretation</hi> a feeding upon our Crucified Jeſus; in the account of God, and conſtruction of the Goſpel. We are <hi>reputed</hi> and <hi>eſteemed</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that Sacrifice which he offered up, and ſo are entitled to all thoſe mercies which that Sacrifice was offered up for. For the opening of this matter we muſt remember, how Mankind were wont of old to participate of thoſe things which they had firſt offered up in Sacrifice; as the <hi>Jews</hi> (for inſtance) were wont to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of their Peace-offerings, and of the Paſchal Lamb. Now this Feaſt being <hi>Analogous</hi> and anſwerable to thoſe; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59160:75"/>
to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> courſe and the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> manner of Feaſting, Chriſtians muſt have fed upon <hi>Their</hi> Sacrifice (that is upon Chriſts own <hi>Natural</hi> Fleſh) as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were wont to ſeed upon <hi>their</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.

                  </note> for all Chriſtians in all Ages; and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too, that the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Chriſts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fleſh was not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> in it ſelf, but that the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of this Feaſt might be very well anſwer'd by our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon ſomething elſe in the <hi>Place</hi> of Chriſt, therefore at the inſtitution of this Ordinance he appointed us the uſe of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> inſtead of giving us his very Body and Blood, which he gave to God as a Sacrifice for us. Theſe Creatures are the Symbols and Repreſentations of his Body and Blood; they are ſubſtituted in the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>room</hi> of them; and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of the one, and the drinking of the other, is, to all intents, as valid and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59160:75"/>
effectual to us, as if we did actually partake of thoſe things which they do <hi>repreſent,</hi> and in <hi>lieu</hi> of which they are appointed. This I take to be part of the meaning of our Saviours words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> and <hi>this is my Blood:</hi> As if he had ſaid, this Bread is <hi>inſtead</hi> of my Fleſh, and this Wine is in the <hi>Room</hi> of my blood. This is a Natural and an eaſie interpretation; 'tis fair, and rational, and full of ſenſe; and 'twould ſerve to ſilence a great many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies among Chriſtians, were it but admitted; would they put in but this <hi>one</hi> word, <hi>inſtead;</hi> and underſtand our Saviour to mean, this is <hi>inſtead</hi> of that, in the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>room</hi> of it. Nor do I ſee any reaſon in the World againſt this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For all men know, that the Jews were wont to ſpeak after a conciſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, meaning ſomething which they did not fully expreſs; of which there are a thouſand inſtances and examples in Holy Writ; and why may we not allow, that our Saviour ſpake now (as other Jews did, nay as he himſelf did at other times) after a ſhort conciſe manner, ſaying of the Bread, this is my Body, but intending thus much, This is <hi>inſtead</hi> of my Body. The <hi>Analogy</hi> of this Feaſt to other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Banquets, doth plainly and infallibly argue, that our Saviours words are thus
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59160:76"/>
to be interpreted, becauſe we feed here upon Bread, inſtead of eating the very Fleſh of our Sacrifice. And I am confirmed in this opinion, by an obſervation that<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>Sect. 4. in fine</hi> And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> on <hi>Matth. 26.</hi> 26.</note> hath been made by two learned Doctors of our Church, who have noted, that the Lamb for the Paſchal Supper, being dreſt and ſet upon the Table, the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to call it, the <hi>Body of the Paſſeover,</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> of the Paſchal Lamb. If this be ſo, it is reaſonable to believe, that our Saviour <hi>alluded</hi> to a Jewiſh Phraſe, that was ready at hand, when he ſaid, this is my Body, or this is in the <hi>room</hi> of me, the <hi>true</hi> Paſſeover. When he took the Bread into his Holy hands and told his Diſciples, that that was his Body, he gave them to underſtand, that they were not to expect to eat of his very <hi>Natural</hi> Fleſh, as they were wont to eat of the Fleſh of a Lamb; but inſtead of that, they were to eat <hi>Bread,</hi> which ſhould be as Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to his Church, as the eating the body of the Paſſeover had been unto the Jews; it ſhould be all one to us as if we did eat of his very Body. His ſpeech may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paraphraſed after this manner: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hitherto it hath been cuſtomary among people to feaſt upon the Dead Carcaſs of a dumb Animal, in Token that they were in Covenant with God, and were entitled
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59160:76"/>
to all the mercies of the Covenant: And whereas the Lamb is a Type of me; to the intent now that you, and the reſt of my followers may be aſſured, that you ſhall have a certain intereſt in my Sacrifice, and ſhall receive infinite bleſſings by my death, though you are not to feed upon my very natural Fleſh; Lo, <hi>inſtead</hi> and in the <hi>Room</hi> of that, I appoint you to Feaſt after this manner, and to look upon it as a feaſting upon <hi>me,</hi> and upon my Sacrificed body, tho you do not eat of the very <hi>identical</hi> oblation, as hath been uſual hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; and I would have you be ſatisfied, that as often as ye ſhall eat this bread and drink this Cup, ye ſhall be ſuppoſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and reckoned to participate of me my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now this I call the <hi>Myſtical</hi> partaking of Chriſts body and blood; becauſe, by the celebration of this Myſtery, we are preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and <hi>reputed</hi> to do ſo; we do in <hi>effect</hi> partake of both, by partaking of thoſe things which do repreſent, and are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be taken in the <hi>place</hi> of both; and we are as truly ſaid to partake of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as the Jews were ſaid to partake of theirs, when they did eat of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oblations. This is the firſt and great bleſſing we receive.</p>
               <p>2. Hence we conclude in the ſecond
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59160:77"/>
place, that every Communicant who is rightly prepared and diſpos'd, hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſolid and ſubſtantial grounds for his <hi>hopes</hi> touching the <hi>Pardon</hi> of his <hi>Sins.</hi> For ſince by this viſible Pledge of Gods Love we gain an intereſt in the Sacrifice of Chriſts death, ſince we are reckoned to participate of Chriſts Body and Blood; ſince we are partakers of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were of the <hi>Altar,</hi> it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that we have all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of our Lords Paſſion; and ſo, that we ought to be aſſured of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſincerity of Gods promiſe, that he will forgive and blor out all our miſcarriages; becauſe it was for that end, that Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>But this will more evidently yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider, 1. The Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Feaſt to the ancient Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Banquets in general: 2. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of it to thoſe Feaſts which were uſed after Sin-offerings in particular: And thirdly if we conſider the words of our Saviour at the inſtitution of this Rite.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt then it is already proved, that Gods ordering his people to Feaſt upon part of their Sacrifices, was a ſign and Token to them, that they were in favour and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, that they had a <hi>Right</hi> unto all his promiſes, that their Sacrifices
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59160:77"/>
were accepted Kindly, and were Imputed unto ſuch as had offered them. By the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Solemnity of Eating and drinking in Gods preſence they were aſſured, that now they were in a State of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> with him, and had a Title to all thoſe mercies which their Sacrifices were intended for. Seeing therefore that this Feaſt is <hi>anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> unto thoſe, it argues plainly, that as the Eating of Sacrifical Feaſts was an Evidence unto the Jews, that they were benefitted by the oblations, and were in Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſo the partaking of this Sacrifical Feaſt is an evidence unto us Chriſtians, that we are Benefitted by Chriſts Oblation of himſelf, and are in <hi>Favour</hi> with God alſo; and conſequently, that we have a Right to his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that he will <hi>Forgive</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> us, that being a main part of Gods Covenant, one of his <hi>Principal</hi> Promiſes, an Eminent Bleſſing, and ſuch a Singular Expreſſion of his Favour, as every Soul of man is Highly concern'd moſt earneſtly to Hunger and Thirſt after.</p>
               <p>2. But for the further confirmation of this matter we are to note, that this is not a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice <hi>at large,</hi> but a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice for <hi>Sin</hi> in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, you muſt remember that there were certain Oblations appointed by the Law, which were called <hi>Sin offerings</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59160:78"/>
becauſe they were intended to make an <hi>Atonement</hi> for all iniquities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, both of the Heart and of the Hand, whether they were offences againſt the Firſt, or againſt the Second Table. Of theſe Sacrifices the <hi>People</hi> of the Jews were never ſuffered to eat; no, nor the Prieſts themſelves <hi>ſometimes,</hi> as when it was a <hi>whole burnt offering,</hi> or a Sacrifice of <hi>Expiation,</hi> that was to be burnt without the <hi>Camp;</hi> wich was a Lively Type of Chriſt, wo was Sacrificed without the <hi>City,</hi> Nevertheleſs, theſe Sacrifices were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Other</hi> ſorts of Oblations, which the People were <hi>allowed</hi> to eat of, and their eating thereof was a Pledge and <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> to them, that their Atonement was now made, and their <hi>Pardon</hi> given. Why now, Chriſt was made <hi>Sin for us</hi> (that is, he was made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins,) <hi>though be knew no Sin.</hi> And as he was our <hi>Sin offering,</hi> ſo our eating at the Holy Table is a <hi>Token</hi> and Argument to us, that God is at Peace which us, and that our Atonement is made for all our iniquities, trangreſſions, and ſins. Nay, <hi>we</hi> have a far greater Priviledge in this reſpect, than the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had for <hi>they</hi> were <hi>not</hi> permitted to eat the the fleſh of a <hi>Sin-offering;</hi> but <hi>we are,</hi> that is, we are permitted to eat of Bread
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59160:78"/>
                  <hi>inſtead</hi> of it. They were never allowed to Drink the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>any</hi> of their Sacrifices, but we are; that is, we are allowed to drink wine <hi>inſtead</hi> of Chriſts Bloud, Theſe <note n="a" place="margin">Nova eſt hujus Sacramenti doctrina, &amp; Scholae Evangelicae hoc primum magiſterium protule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp; doctore Chriſto primùm haec mundo innotuit diſciplina, ut biberent Sanguinem Chriſtiani, &amp;c. Autor Serm de Caena Dom. <hi>Cipriano</hi> aſcript.</note> are <hi>Singular</hi> Priviledges to us; and ſo they are <hi>Greater Aſſurances</hi> alſo of our Pardon and Atonement: Chriſt gives us his Body and Bloud too, for our plenary Conviction and Conſolation, touching the Remiſſion of our Sins. In this reſpect our Chriſtian Feaſt doth far <hi>out go</hi> all thoſe which they uſed under the Law. For they could parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate but of <hi>ſome</hi> of their Sacrifices, and but of <hi>Part</hi> of them too: we participate even of our: <hi>Propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice; nay, of our <hi>whole</hi> propitiation. Whereas the Bloud of every Sacrifice was wont to be poured out at the Altar, and not ſo much as one <hi>Drop</hi> of it was to be taſted of, either by the <hi>Poeple</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> behold ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, you have liberty to participate even of the <hi>Bloud</hi> of my Sacrifice; as this Bread is in the Room of my Body, ſo is this Wine in the place of my Heart Bloud; and I give you this particular command and Priviledge, that ye Drink of it every one of you, though no ſuch thing hath been allowed hitherto at any Sacrifical Solemnity. Which ſhews,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59160:79"/>
that our <hi>whole</hi> Sacrifice is fully imputed to every worthy Communicant for his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>3. Thus the <hi>Analogy</hi> of this Sacrifical Banquet doth prove, that every worthy partaker thereof hath the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſubſtantial reaſons to hope in God firmly, and to depend upon Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and promiſe for his Pardon. But thirdly, the <hi>words</hi> of our Saviour himſelf do ſeem to argue this beyond all manner of controverſie, though the <hi>Socinians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>Evade</hi> the force of them. For ſpeaking of the <hi>Cup,</hi> he ſaid expreſly, <hi>Drink ye all of it, for this is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Though it be granted (what the <hi>Socinians</hi> object) that thoſe words, <hi>for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> do immediately relate to the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Blood,</hi> which was ſpoken of juſt before; yet they endeavour in vain to<note place="margin">Lud. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zogenius <hi>in</hi> Loc.</note> conclude thence, that they have no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>drinking</hi> of the <hi>Cup.</hi> Nor have they reaſon enough to affirm, that Remiſſion of ſins is the fruit of Chriſts Paſſion only, but not the effect of our drinking, becauſe he ſaid not, <hi>drink</hi> ye
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59160:79"/>
all for the Remiſſion of Sins; but drink ye of the Wine that <hi>repreſents</hi> my <hi>Blood,</hi> which is ſhed for the Remiſſion of ſins. For, ſince our <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> is the certain, immediate, and neceſſary conſequence of his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> it will undeniably follow, that it we participate of his <hi>Blood</hi> (as I have ſhew'd we do) we muſt be ſuppoſed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take alſo of that which is the inſeparable <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of his Blood ſhedding. That which brings the cauſe muſt alſo bring the <hi>effect,</hi> which is the Natural reſult of it: The ſame action, which makes us partakers of the Sacrifice <hi>it ſelf,</hi> muſt likewiſe make us partakers of the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of the Sacrifice: So that it matters not <hi>how</hi> our Saviour expreſt the thing, as long as he expreſt it <hi>enough:</hi> Since he firſt tells us, that his Blood was for our Remiſſion; and then bids us to <hi>Drink</hi> of that Blood; and then aſſures us that our drinking thus of <hi>Wine</hi> is in <hi>effect</hi> the drinking of his very Blood, we have all the reaſon in the World to believe, that by our thus drinking we <hi>obtain</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and that our Lord commanded us to drink in <hi>Order</hi> thereunto. The truth is, Pardon of ſin is the Bleſſed fruit both of Chriſts dying, and of our <hi>receiving:</hi> Of the former, as the meritorious <hi>Cauſe</hi> that purchaſed pardon for all in general: Of the latter, as the ordinary <hi>inſtrument</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59160:80"/>
that conveys the pardon to every Holy Soul in particular. The ſhedding of Chriſts Blood did procure and ratifie Gods promiſe of Grace to all <hi>Mankind;</hi> and the receiving of this <hi>Wine</hi> (which is the Symbol of that <hi>Blood</hi>) is the Seal of that promiſe to all worthy <hi>Communicants,</hi> when Chriſt was ſlain upon the Croſs, he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this favour of God, that all Men were then put into a <hi>ſalvable</hi> condition, into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of forgiveneſs, into a way whereby they might be pardoned <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi> if they would not be wanting to themſelves, perfect Peace and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was then <hi>merited;</hi> and it was meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all that ſhould accept of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bond or free; for <hi>he taſted Death for every Man, Heb.</hi> 2. 9. He died for <hi>all that were dead,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. Thus far the Scripture ſpeaketh in <hi>general</hi> terms; but it ſaith nothing of <hi>Me,</hi> or of <hi>Thee,</hi> as to our particular <hi>Perſons.</hi> We find not <hi>our names</hi> there; much leſs can we find our Names in the book of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:</hi> All that we can do is to judge of our ſelves by examining our ſtate, by fair probabilities, and rational Collection. And to ſtrengthen our hopes, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh every mans humble confidence, this Ordinance was appointed; that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen as we eat this Bread, and drink this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59160:80"/>
Cup of the Lord; after a worthy manner, we may be <hi>comfortably</hi> and <hi>reaſonably</hi> well perſwaded, that our ſins and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are done away. For that pardon is by this Ordinance <hi>applyed</hi> to every one in <hi>particular,</hi> which before was <hi>bought</hi> for all <hi>univerſally;</hi> and any man that is but ſatisfied of the truth of his <hi>Faith,</hi> and of the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his <hi>Repentance,</hi> may go away from the Holy Table well ſatisfied to, that he now ſtands <hi>fair</hi> in the eye and favour of God, and ſo ſhall ſtand ſtill, if he doth but hold up his goings in Gods ways, ſo that his footſteps do not ſlide back into <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope, that by this time I have fully proved and illuſtrated this matter. But yet before I let it go, I would note this one thing, that our Saviour ſpake <hi>expreſly</hi> of the Remiſſion of our ſins, when he ſpake of the adminiſtration of the <hi>Cup.</hi> Neither of the three Evangeliſts, who have recorded the Hiſtory of the inſtitution of this Myſtery, nor St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it, takes any notice of that <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> when our Lord ſpake of the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the <hi>Bread.</hi> Indeed it is not to be doubted, but our Saviours Body was broken for our forgiveneſs; nor do I doubt but his meaning was ſo, when he ſaid, this is my body which is given for

you (that is for your <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) but that particular <hi>expreſſion,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Remiſſion of Sin, was uſed by him (for ought we know) only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Drinking of the <hi>Wine.</hi> Hence I infer, that for the Peace of a Mans Conſcience, and for the ſatisfaction of his mind, that he is in an hopeful ſtate of Salvation, it is neceſſary for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament in <hi>both</hi> kinds. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgiveneſs of ſin is the effect of the <hi>whole</hi> Ordinance; ſeeing our Saviour ſeems to have a particular and <hi>ſpecial</hi> regard to our drinking of the <hi>Cup;</hi> and ſeeing he gives us this reaſon for it, becauſe it is the Sacrament of his blood, that is for our Remiſſion; I ſay, ſeeing that the thing ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus, I cannot ſee what ſubſtantial and ſolid grounds men can have to be confident of their Pardon, if they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate not of the Wine, as well as of the Bread.</p>
               <p>If the thing were not prejudicial to the Peace of mens Souls, yet it would be impoſſible to Vindicate the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the guilt of Impiety, Sacriledge, and Innovation, for Denying the Cup to all the Lay-People of her Communion. For the Holy Jeſus himſelf adminiſtred both the Bread and the Wine to his Diſciples; and as He had done, he commanded them to do
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59160:81"/>
alſo: nay, as if he then fore-ſaw, and was minded to prevent that abuſe, which hath lately crept into the Roman Church, he Poſitively commanded his Diſciples, when he reached out the Cup to them, that they ſhould <hi>All</hi> drink of it; and his Reaſon was this, becauſe his Bloud (of which the wine was a Figure) was now to be ſhed for the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of <hi>All.</hi> So that were this argument driven home upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, they muſt be brought to confeſs (if they will ſpeak out) either that the Cup is to be given to Lay-people, or elſe that Chriſts blood was not ſhed for Lay-peoples Sins. I will not enter into that enquiry, how <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> the perſons were, to whom our Saviour ſpake at that time. Though ſome are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to tell us, that they were only the twelve Apoſtles (who were then in the quality of Prieſts) yet this is a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent aſſertion, which we need not grant: For though it be ſaid, that he ſate down with the twelve, yet it doth not follow, that no more than twelve were there. It is probable, that the good man of the Houſe, who is ſuppoſed to have been a Believer, might be there among the reſt; at leaſt it is improbable, that the Holy Virgin, of whom he took ſuch care at his Death, ſhould not be with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59160:82"/>
him at his laſt Supper, eſpecially ſince he admitted the Traitor <hi>Judas.</hi> But ſuppoſe none but the twelve were Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, yet they were the repreſentatives of the <hi>whole</hi> Church; and what he ſaid unto <hi>them,</hi> he muſt be underſtood to have ſpoken in reference unto <hi>All;</hi> that every Member of his Family ſhould drink of the Cup, as well as eat of the Bread. Accordingly was the practice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the days of old. Whereſoever St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the adminiſtration of this Sacrament, he ſpeaks of <hi>both</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they were communicated of, and this, he ſaith, was that, <hi>which he had received of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21. And that the ſame was the uſage of the times following, is undeniably clear out of the writings of many antient Fathers; both of Greek and Latine Churches, who Celebrated this Myſtery as we do, which I note the rather, that I may lay open thoſe Lyars, who, to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their corruptions, confidently tell poor ignorant people this Monſtrous falſity, that Antiquity is on their ſide.

aſſured of Gods purpoſes of Grace towards us, and being ſatisfied in a good meaſure, that we are now in a Happy condition. 'Tis true, before men go to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ought to be well ſatisfied of Gods merciful Kindneſs, and gratious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards them; for this is matter of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> which are the things we muſt neceſſarily go upon in all our addreſſes unto the Father of mercies: but yet the fruit of eating and drinking here, is <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to every honeſt hearted Communicant, becauſe his Faith and Hope is hereby much the <hi>ſtronger,</hi> and built upon more <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> grounds. 'Tis true alſo, that a mans pardon is <hi>begun</hi> before he doth make his appraoches; that is, if he makes his approaches regularly, and like a good Chriſtian; for he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent firſt of all his tranſgreſſions, and that doth <hi>diſpoſe</hi> him for Gods mercy, and makes him <hi>meet</hi> to be a Partaker of it.

               </argument>
               <p>BEſides that participation of Chriſt <hi>Crucified</hi> which is <hi>Myſtical,</hi> by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,</hi> and <hi>Conſtruction</hi> (as I have ſhew'd already) there is alſo at this Ordinance a participation of Chriſt <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So 'tis Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the Prayer of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</note> which is <hi>Real,</hi> by our being actually made partakers of his moſt <hi>Bleſſed Body and Bloud.</hi> This is manifeſtely the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church, that the Body and Bloud of Chriſt are <hi>verily and indeed</hi> taken and received by the Faithful in the Lords Supper; and that our <hi>Souls</hi> are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and Refreſhed by the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as our <hi>Bodies</hi> are by the Bread and Wine. Now our <hi>Bodies</hi> receive nouriſhment by our actual receiving the very <hi>Subſtances</hi> of Bread and Wine; and ſo (according to the <hi>Compariſon</hi>) our <hi>Souls</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59160:86"/>
alſo do receive ſtrengh and Comfort, by actually receiving and participating of the very <hi>Nature</hi> of Chriſt. After the ſame manner was the Faith of the Church of <hi>England</hi> delivered in the beginning of the Reformation by that truly Learned and Great man Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in that Admirable Book of his called a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true and Catholick Doctrine of the Sacrament;</hi> wherein he doth often uſe<note place="margin">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59160:87"/>
Sacramently <hi>Imputed</hi> unto us for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; but moreover the very <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> Jeſus, now Living and ſitting in Heaven, is (in the Reality of the thing) Actually Communicated unto us from above, and verily received by us in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And the outward Elements of Bread and Wine are not onely <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi> (much leſs <hi>Empty</hi> Tokens and <hi>Bare</hi> Signs) of Chriſts Body and Bloud; but are alſo the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of bringing the whole Chriſt to us; ſo that his Fleſh and Bloud do <hi>Really,</hi> but after a Spiritual and wonderfull manner, go along with the Bread and Wine, to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and Refreſh the <hi>Soul,</hi> as <hi>They</hi> do the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know very well, that I am now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the Tendereſt point concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sacrament; perhaps, upon the Niceſt ſpeculation in the whole Body of Divinity: Nor am I inſenſible how wary and Cautious Divines are, what they ſay, and how they unfold their thoughts of this matter. Indeed it is that, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us a great deal of Conſideration and Pains, aſwell to <hi>Conceive</hi> a Right notion of it, as to <hi>Expreſs</hi> it ſo as to make it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to <hi>others.</hi> But not withſtanding the Difficulty of the thing, it being ſo very Uſefull and Neceſſary for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59160:87"/>
of every mans mind, I ſhall take upon me to diſcourſe of it at large, but without trangreſſing (I hope) the due bounds of Modeſty and Truth.</p>
               <p>To clear my way as I go from one foul miſtake, we are to note, that Chriſt is not ſo preſent in the Sacrament as to be eaten after a <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Groſs</hi> manner; neither are the Elements ſo changed by any act of Conſecration, as to be turned out of one ſubſtance into another, out of the Subſtance of Bread and Wine into the Subſtance of our Lords Natural Fleſh and Bloud. This indeed is the Faith of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and they have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the word, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> to ſignifie and Expreſs their Faith: and it implyeth theſe three things: 1. That the <hi>Nature</hi> and Matter of the Elements <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth</hi> away. 2. That the <hi>Accidents</hi> thereof (as they call it) meaning the Colour, the Smell, the Taſte, the Quantity of the Elements do all <hi>remain</hi> without their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Natural ſuject. 3. That Chriſt's <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Body ſupplyeth the room of Bread, and that this Bloud is in the Place of Wine. Now I might paſs over this with quick diſpatch, by referring you to a great many Learned and Unanſwerable Books, which have been written againſt this Monſtrous Error (to ſay no worſe of it) but to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59160:88"/>
ſave you the charge and pains of ſo much travel, I deſire you 1. To Conſider in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> that there are <hi>four</hi> things which are Infallibly able to ſatisfie a mans Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the Truth or Falſity of any thing whatſoever, <hi>viz.</hi> The Uſe of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> the Suffrage of Right <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the help of <hi>Tradition.</hi> And if men will pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly contend for a propoſition in ſpight of the <hi>Concurrent</hi> Evidence which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt it, by <hi>all</hi> theſe Demonſtrative mediums, which ought, and are enough to Convince every man, they were as good tell us plainly, that they are <hi>Reſolved</hi> to be Infidels, or Scepticks, or to believe no more than what they themſelves <hi>pleaſe:</hi> for ſtronger arguments than theſe four can never be offered to any.</p>
               <p>Now thus ſtands the caſe between Us and the Romaniſts: they diſpute for their beloved Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; and to maintain the Controverſie, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Definitious of their <hi>own</hi> Church; that is, they will be <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> too. We plead againſt their Doctrine, that 'tis contrary to every Teſt which ſhould govern Rational Creatures in their Sentiments. And though the very <hi>Mentioning</hi> of this palpable Error be enough to Expoſe it to <hi>Scorn</hi> and Laughter, yet
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59160:88"/>
for the further diſcovery thereof, obſerve in <hi>particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. How it contradicted the Teſtimony of our very <hi>Senſes.</hi> We cannot conceive, but that God gave us our Senſes as helps to inform our Underſtanding: nor can it be ſuppoſed with any Colour of Truth, that <hi>all</hi> men ſhould be <hi>Conſtantly</hi> deceived in the perpetual uſe of their Senſes, when their <hi>Faculties</hi> are <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of their Senſe is Adequate and <hi>Proper:</hi> this would be as Ridiculous and Abſurd, as to ſay, that none of us yet ever ſaw the light, tho our eyes be open, and the Sun every day Appears. Now that which we contend for is as clear to our Senſe, as the Sun is at high Noon. For we ſee it, we ſmell it, we taſte it; we feel it (by <hi>Four</hi> of our Senſes we find what we receive at the Communion) to be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> and why ſhould we fancy our ſelves deceived in this caſe, more then S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was when he put his <hi>finger</hi> into our Saviorus <hi>Side?</hi> why ſhould not <hi>we</hi> be ſatisfied by ſo <hi>many</hi> of our Senſes, that it is Bread and Wine, when <hi>He</hi> was convinced by his bare <hi>Touch,</hi> that it was his Lord and his God? Upon two accounts it is impoſſible for Conſidering men to think, that a Fallacy can be put upon us in this matter. For 1. ſhould we Suppoſe the Omnipotent power of God
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59160:89"/>
could turn Bread into Fleſh, the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread remaining <hi>ſtill,</hi> yet it would not at all <hi>anſwer</hi> that great <hi>End</hi> for which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have been ever wrought; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not Reaſonable for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God <hi>would</hi> do it. It would be indeed the <hi>Greateſt</hi> of all Miracles, and infinitely beyond that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> Himſelf did, when he turned <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine;</hi> for there the Colour, the Taſte, the Smell, the Operation of Water was changed as well as the Subſtance. And as it is not in the leaſt probable, that every the Meaneſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhould every day do a <hi>Greater</hi> Miracle than ever our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did, ſo it is not in the leaſt Credible, that God Himſelf would do a Miracle but to <hi>convince</hi> men of Some Neceſſary and Important Truth. Should he do a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for no other end but onely to ſhew his <hi>Power,</hi> of neceſſity it muſt muſt be <hi>Seen,</hi> it muſt be <hi>ſhewed</hi> in ſome ſenſible inſtance; for otherwiſe it could not be a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of his Omnipotence. But God never yet did any Miracle for the <hi>Miracle-ſake,</hi> but that thereby he might <hi>Atteſt</hi> the Truth of ſome <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and might <hi>Convince</hi> men of Something, which they could not well be convinced of, <hi>but</hi> by Gods ſetting his own <hi>Seal</hi> to it after that manner.

have been ſtill <hi>Apparent</hi> and <hi>Open</hi> to the <hi>Senſes;</hi> and 'tis Neceſſary they <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſo, becauſe they would be of no <hi>Uſe</hi> were they not <hi>perceived;</hi> neither could they <hi>prove</hi> any thing, unleſs they themſelves were <hi>Manifeſt:</hi> And if we reckon up all the Miracles that ever were done in the world from the days of Moſes to the times of the Goſpel, we ſhall find, that inſtead of being <hi>Concealed</hi> and Hid from men, they have been always Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and made <hi>Plain</hi> to mens <hi>Senſes.</hi> Now this doth utterly baffle the groundleſs pretence of Tranſubſtantiation: for that Doctrine ſuppoſeth God to do the <hi>Higheſt</hi> Miracle that ever was done, to no <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> purpoſe; neither to edifie <hi>Us,</hi> not to ſhew <hi>Himſelf;</hi> and how can we think, that he will make Wonders and his Power <hi>Cheap,</hi> and with an Almighty hand alter the Courſe and Nature of things ſo as not to <hi>Glorifie</hi> himſelf, nor to do Us <hi>Good</hi> by ſo doing? This would be a Miracle, that could not in any wiſe ſerve the <hi>Ends</hi> of all Miracles; and it becomes us not to believe that the All-good, and All wiſe God will deceive <hi>four</hi> of our Senſes at once to no End at <hi>all,</hi> ſince it hath been all along the method of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſatisfie All our Senſes for the <hi>Beſt</hi> purpoſes.</p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59160:90"/>But this is not all: there is ſecondly a Worſe thing behind yet, The Romaniſts by crying down the Credit of our <hi>Senſes</hi> give Atheiſtical Spirits, and all that are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our Religion, advantage and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to <hi>Diſcredit</hi> all the Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> and therefore their Hypotheſis is ſo far from being Believed, that it is to be Condemned as <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> in the Higheſt degree. For, if when our Senſes tell us, this is Bread, and this is Wine, we may not <hi>Truſt</hi> our <hi>Senſes,</hi> Ill men will preſently draw thence this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Concluſion, that they have no Reaſon to give credit to <hi>any</hi> Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Creed;</hi> eſpecially if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>Infallible</hi> in this definition, <hi>that mens Judgements muſt not be governed by what they See or feel.</hi> The credibility of the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> dependeth <hi>Originally</hi> upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Senſe:</hi> and we therefore believe the Evangelical tidings to be <hi>True,</hi> becauſe we believe they were <hi>Preached</hi> by the moſt Holy Jeſus, and were <hi>Atteſted</hi> by God himſelf, who by working wonders Confirmed the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which were taught by his Eternal Son.

Briefly; the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt from the Dead, is the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Article, upon which many others do depend; for <hi>if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our Preaching in vain, and your faith is alſo vain. 1.

Now Chriſt <hi>himſelf</hi> appealed to the <hi>Senſes</hi> of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to Convince them that he was Riſen <hi>indeed.</hi> As they were frighted at his appearance, and fancied that it was a <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> to Satisfie them to the Full, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my hands and my feet,</hi> that it is I my ſelf; <hi>handle me, and ſee,</hi> for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye <hi>ſee</hi> me have, <hi>S.

The Apoſtles had the Teſtimony but of <hi>Three</hi> Senſes; we have the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Four,</hi> and if <hi>our</hi> Senſes muſt not be

believed, then not <hi>theirs</hi> neither, and then what becomes of our Chriſtian Religion?</p>
               <p>2. Methinks all thoughtful men ſhould <hi>miſtruſt</hi> that cauſe, which to ſecure it ſelf from the danger of a Shock, <hi>blinds</hi> their eyes, and befools them into ſuch abſolute <hi>Bondage,</hi> that they muſt be obliged to believe, that ſnow is Ink, and that Ice is fire. But beſides this, ſecondly, nothing can be more contrary to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> than the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man is the Candle of the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20. 27. and 'tis ſenſeleſs to imagine, that when God ſet up this lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in our hearts, his meaning was, that we ſhould mind it no more than as if we lived in utter <hi>darkneſs,</hi> or that it ſhould be leſs uſeful to us than the light of a <hi>Glow worm.</hi> Now firſt this is a certain principle of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that a man can have but <hi>one</hi> body, and ſo we are to conclude, that Chriſt himſelf had no <hi>more.</hi> But if that which he gave to his Diſciples was his very <hi>Natural</hi> Body, conſiſting of ſo many organical parts, then had he <hi>more</hi> Bodies than one (even as many as there were Morſels) becauſe it is <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> that <hi>every</hi> Diſciple received the body of Chriſt <hi>entirely.</hi> Now this is an imagination which the greateſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> yet never durſt to defend. Some indeed held of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59160:92"/>
old, that Chriſt had no real Body <hi>at all,</hi> but only an <hi>imaginary,</hi> and <hi>Phantaſtick</hi> being, which was a deluſion of mens ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo the followers of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the Marciouites, and others did falſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But that he had <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one</hi> natural Body (properly ſo called) <hi>none</hi> did ever affirm. And yet this is the conſequence of the Romiſh Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. For either his Natural body is not in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>at all;</hi> or elſe it is not there <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>entirely;</hi> or elſe it muſt be ſuppoſed to be <hi>multiplied</hi> proportionably to the number of the conſecrated Wafers: And hence it muſt follow of neceſſity, that as at the inſtitution of this Sacrament, Chriſt had ſome Bodies which were <hi>not</hi> Crucified (for the Supper was <hi>before</hi> the Paſſion, and that body which every Apoſtle did eat was <hi>never</hi> Crucified) ſo ſtill that Chriſt hath an <hi>indefinite</hi> number of Bodies, even as many as there are <hi>Communicants</hi> in the whole World: And then where ſhall we find that <hi>one</hi> man Chriſt Jeſus, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. the gift of grace hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded unto many by <hi>one man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Secondly theſe are certain and Eternal principles of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> that one and the ſame body can be but in one and the ſame <hi>Place</hi> at once, as my body cannot be here and at the <hi>Indies</hi> in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59160:92"/>
(for then it would be <hi>one</hi> Body, and yet not one at the ſame time.) it is certain by reaſon that a body muſt have <hi>Parts,</hi> diviſible and <hi>diſtinct</hi> the one from another, as every humane Body hath a Leg diſtinct from the arm, and the head diſtinct from the trunk (for elſe it would be a body, and <hi>not</hi> a body.) A body muſt be <hi>Circumſcribed</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſpace proportionable to its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions (for elſe it would be a <hi>finite</hi> and yet an <hi>infinite</hi> ſubſtance.) A body cannot be broken into <hi>pieces,</hi> and yet remain <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> (for then it would be <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>not</hi> whole.) Theſe and the like are <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> principles, which all men that will obey common reaſon muſt agree in; and they are taught us both in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Heathen Philoſophy as <hi>common</hi> Notions and Maxims, as <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> as that <hi>one</hi> and <hi>one</hi> makes <hi>two:</hi> So that to contradict theſe principles is to tell Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that they are all <hi>mad-men</hi> and <hi>fools</hi> that are not able to tell their <hi>Fingers.</hi> And yet theſe principles are contradicted by the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which is made up of I know not how many impoſſibilites, which we can no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to reaſon, than we can prove that the ſame propoſition is both true and falſe in the ſame reſpect; and that man, who
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59160:93"/>
believes that Doctrine, muſt believe the groſſeſt and moſt palpable contradictions. For according to this rate theſe monſtrous <hi>Abſardities</hi> will follow; that Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh is Circumſcribed in Heaven (as every body muſt be confined to a certain place) and yet at the ſame time is in millions of places here on Earth, and yet <hi>one</hi> Body ſtill: That it is <hi>whole,</hi> and yet is <hi>broken:</hi> That it is <hi>divided,</hi> and yet is <hi>entire;</hi> that it is <hi>entire</hi> in every Wafer, and yet if you break thoſe Wafers into a thouſand particles, that the body of Chriſt is <hi>one</hi> ſtill, and <hi>whole</hi> in every the leaſt <hi>particle:</hi> That tho there be feet, and hands, and head, and many other conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent and integral parts in Chriſts body, and tho all theſe parts are the one <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the other, and <hi>by</hi> the other, and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from</hi> the other, yet that all are ſo <hi>jumbled</hi> and <hi>crowded</hi> together into a <hi>point,</hi> that whoſoever eateth but a <hi>piece</hi> that is no bigger than a <hi>Pins point,</hi> eateth <hi>all</hi> and every <hi>part</hi> of Chriſts body: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſuch <hi>contradictions</hi> there are, ſo wild, ſo irrational, ſo inconſiſtent with common ſenſe, that 'tis as tireſome to count them up, as to tell the number of the Stars.</p>

               </p>
               <p>3. But yet did the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſay expreſly, that what we taſte and ſee at the Lords Table is the very natural Fleſh and Bloud of Chriſt, we ought rather to <hi>disbelieve</hi> our ſenſes and reaſon too, than <hi>contradict</hi> the Word of God.

               <p>Now 1. as touching the Body of Chriſt, the Scripture tells us, that it is <hi>gone up into Heaven</hi> there to abide till the day of final Judgement. To this purpoſe S. <hi>John</hi> tells us chap. 14. and 16. that Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples before his death, telling them that he was about to <hi>leave</hi> them, and to <hi>depart</hi> from them, that he was going his way to the <hi>Father,</hi> and was <hi>leaving</hi> the world. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions muſt neceſſarily be underſtood

of his <hi>Bodily</hi> abſence, that his Humane Nature was to be no longer here <hi>below,</hi> or elſe the ſenſe would be <hi>Impertinent</hi> and to no purpoſe. For his deſign was to <hi>Prepare</hi> the minds of his followers, that they might not be <hi>dejected</hi> at his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,</hi> nor ſurprized with it: And to that end he told them of it <hi>before hand,</hi> and aſſured them withal, that in <hi>lieu</hi> of his <hi>Corporal</hi> preſence he would give them his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be with his Church to the end of the world. Now to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were theſe Expreſſions and Promiſes, if he was to be with them ſtill in <hi>Perſon,</hi> and if his Body was to be handled by them <hi>ſtill,</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> The Poor (ſaid he) ye have with you always, but <hi>Me ye have not always,</hi> Matth. 26. 11. This is <hi>contradicted</hi> by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for they ſay, we have him with us <hi>ſtill,</hi> even in his <hi>perſon,</hi> though he be not viſible to our eyes, nay, they pretend to have him much <hi>better</hi> than the <hi>Jews</hi> had, for they <hi>ſaw</hi> him, and <hi>heard</hi> him, and <hi>touched</hi> him only, but <hi>theſe</hi> pretend to <hi>eat</hi> him too, and to take him down into their very <hi>Stomachs.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of him affirmed, that he was <hi>in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> was to be <hi>until the times of Reſtitution,</hi> Act. 3. 21. In reſpect of his <hi>Body</hi> he is at the right

Lord! what can a man in his wits collect out of all theſe Texts, but this, that though Chriſt be with us by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet he is at ſuch an infinite diſtance from us in his <hi>Humane</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that till the end of all things we cannot have ſo much as a <hi>Glimpſe</hi> of him, unleſs Heaven be opened to us by a <hi>Miracle,</hi> as it was to <hi>S. Stephen?</hi> Men were as good take the Holy Writers by the Throats, and with violent hands keep them from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>at all,</hi> as diſpute againſt ſuch <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Evidence, touching the abſence of our Saviours Natural Body.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, as touching that which we take into our hands at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the Scripture ſtill calleth it <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> At the inſtitution our Lord pointed to the contents in the Cup, and termed it the <hi>fruit of the Vine.</hi> And ſo he is ſaid to have taken <hi>Bread,</hi> to have bleſſed it, to have broken <hi>it,</hi> and to have given <hi>it</hi> to his Diſciples, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to eat it; meaning plainly, that which he took into his hands, and that was <hi>Bread.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> calls the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, the breaking of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59160:97"/>
                  <hi>Bread, Act.</hi> 2. 42. And S. Paul ſays, 'tis <hi>Bread</hi> which we break, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. that we are Partakers of <hi>Bread, verſ.</hi> 17. and that as often as we eat of it, we eat of <hi>Bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. whence it appears, that 'tis Bread <hi>after</hi> Conſecration as well as <hi>before;</hi> though the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of it be changed, ſo that by it the Body of Chriſt be communicated to us, yet the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it is the ſame ſtill, even <hi>Bread,</hi> as the Scripture calls. For 'tis an eternal truth that where things are of a <hi>Different</hi> Nature (as bread and fleſh are) the one cannot be ſaid to be the other with any Propriety of ſpeech; as <hi>Bertram</hi> rightly argued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that nothing is more abſurd, than to call<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bertran.</hi> de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom.</note> bread, fleſh; or wine, bloud, without a <hi>Figure,</hi> for 'tis as abſurd as to call a Man an Elephant, or a Fiſh a Scorpion. Either then it is not <hi>Bread</hi> (and then the <hi>Scripture</hi> deceives us:) or if it <hi>be</hi> Bread, it is not Chriſts <hi>Natural</hi> Fleſh, (and then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> couſens us; and <hi>there</hi> is the point.)</p>
               <p>The utmoſt that they can pretend from <hi>Scripture</hi> is, that one expreſſion, <hi>this is my Body:</hi> and will you not (ſay they) believe our Saviour <hi>himſelf?</hi> Yes we do firmly believe that to be true, which our Saviour did mean, but the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59160:97"/>
queſtion is, what his meaning was? Now, that thoſe words are not to be taken ſtrictly, and according to the <hi>firſt</hi> Sound of them, will be clear from theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations.</p>
               <p>1. That before men grew <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Angry,</hi> and <hi>Magiſterial</hi> about this matter, ſeveral Doctors even of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church could not find, that our Saviour meant any thing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> by that Phraſe. That Doctrine was defined firſt at the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, a little above 400. years ago; and yet <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Cameracenſis</hi> (who lived after that Council) did hold, that without the Churches <hi>Declaration</hi> there is no place of <hi>Scripture</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth men to believe Tranſubſtantiation. Nay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth the thing to be <hi>Probable</hi> enough (which thoſe<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Euch. lib. 3. c. 23.</note> Doctors ſaid) and by this 'tis manifeſt, that in their <hi>own</hi> opinion Chriſts words may be allowed to bear a very <hi>doubtful</hi> ſenſe; ſo that had it not been out of pure reſpects to the Declaration of their Church, probably they would have been contented, that thoſe words at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <hi>ſhould</hi> have born ſuch a conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as would not have <hi>ſhook</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men ſo notoriouſly.</p>
               <p>2. If we frame notions of things juſt according to the <hi>clink</hi> of a <hi>Phraſe,</hi> we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59160:98"/>
muſt needs entertain very <hi>ſtrange</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of our Saviour himſelf; becauſe he is uſually called a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Way,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>3. As Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſo in <hi>Job.</hi> 6. he ſaith alſo, that he is the <hi>Bread of life;</hi> and that his Fleſh, is <hi>Meat;</hi> and his Bloud, <hi>Drink.</hi> He ſpeaks as plainty and poſitively in the <hi>one</hi> place, as he doth in the other. Now if men affirm, that the bread is changed into Chriſts Fleſh, becauſe Chriſt ſaith poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> they have equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame reaſon to affirm, that Chriſts Fleſh is turned into <hi>Bread,</hi> and his Bloud into <hi>Drink,</hi> becauſe he ſaid <hi>as</hi> poſitively, <hi>My Fleſh is meat indeed,</hi> and my Bloud <hi>Drink indeed.</hi> A latitude muſt be allowed to be as to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of thoſe expreſſions, or elſe men muſt fall into a Labyrinth of abſurdities and contradictions, which they can never wind themſelves out of by the help of any clue.</p>
               <p>4. If we obſerve what our Saviour ſaid to the <hi>Capernaites</hi> upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, we cannot but conclude, that his meaning at both times was myſtical. The ſtory we have in the 6th. of S. <hi>John</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verily, verily (ſaith our Lord) except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of man, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59160:98"/>
drink his bloud, ye have no life in you, <hi>verſ.</hi> 53. This ſeem'd a very Harſh expreſſion, becauſe they conceived (as the Romaniſts do now) that Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Fleſh ſhould be torn in pieces with their Teeth, and that his Natural bloud ſhould be ſuckt out of his veins with their mouths. The bare apprehenſion of this matter turn'd their ſtomachs, ſo that they were ſcandaliz'd preſently and fell off from him. Therefore to rectifie their miſtakes, he expounded himſelf, telling them, that they were not to underſtand him in a literal and carnal ſenſe; no, <hi>the words that I ſpeak unto you they are Spirit, and they are life, verſ.</hi> 63. meaning, that he ſpake My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, and that they were to interpret<note place="margin">So that place was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> his words after a Spiritual manner, and of a Spiritual and Divine way of feeding upon him, and ſo we feed upon Chriſt, who laughd at the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo all good Chriſtians fed upon him for many hundreds of years, before that Doctrine was dreamt of, or thrown about, to debauch and intoxicate the world.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Tranſubſtantion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church. Proved by five Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions touching the common ſenſe of Chriſtian; in the moſt ancient times. A ſhort account of the Doctrine of the Church in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, till the twelfth Century.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>3. 'TIs true, the Papiſts are wont to crack of <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> as if all the ancient Fathers of the Catholick Church were on their ſide. And nothing hath prevailed more with ordinary people to turn or continue Papiſts, than an opinion, that Tranſubſtantiation was all along the Faith of the Chriſtian Church. I confeſs I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much that <hi>common</hi> people will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be judges in this caſe, when they underſtand little of Greek or Latine,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59160:99"/>
much leſs have skill to tell, which of the Books, that are aſcribed to the Fathers, are <hi>Genuine,</hi> and which are <hi>ſuppoſititious.</hi> But alaſs they are taught by their leaders to believe any thing, and to talk by <hi>Rote</hi> like a ſort of men among <hi>our ſelves,</hi> who are readily perſwaded to act any thing that is for the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> for the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> for their darling and dearly beloved <hi>Cauſe,</hi> though they venture their <hi>Necks</hi> and their very <hi>Souls</hi> for an <hi>evil</hi> cauſe ſake.</p>
               <p>Therefore to clear this matter fully, we will once for all <hi>try</hi> the point by unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable authorities, and examine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what the ſenſe of the Chriſtian Church was, chiefly in the Primitive times, and <hi>ex abundanti</hi> in the times <hi>following:</hi> And I am fouly miſtaken, if we do not find, upon the whole enquiry, that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> brag of ſo much) is plainly <hi>againſt</hi> them for above a thouſand years.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this thing, I beg leave to go a little out of the <hi>common</hi> rode, not to trouble my ſelf with an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fatigue of collecting a world of ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the Fathers (a courſe, which tho it be proper enough for a Diſputant, yet may be liable to a great many Cavils.) I ſhall rather chuſe to argue from ſome <hi>obſervations</hi> that may be made upon thoſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59160:100"/>
                  <hi>Controverſies</hi> the Ancient Church had with <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the ſenſe of the Ancient Chriſtians, as to the point under our hands: for this is certain, that we can never <hi>better</hi> learn the ſenſe of the Ancient Church, than out of their <hi>Diſputations,</hi> eſpecially when they go upon the <hi>ſame</hi> grounds, and uſe the <hi>ſame</hi> way of <hi>Argumentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Now, firſt, it is eaſie to obſerve what the ſenſe of the Ancient Church was, as to the eating of Humane <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the drinking of <hi>Bloud.</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> were wont for a long time to throw this in the teeth of the Primitive Chriſtians, that they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Thyeſtean</hi> banquets, and ſtories ran about, that at their ſacred Aſſemblies they killed a Child, and then junketed together upon the tragical diſh. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians granted, that the feaſting upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fleſh and Bloud was a moſt <hi>Barbarous</hi> and Flagitious crime, but they proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Innocent;</hi> they abominated the very thoughts of any ſuch deteſtable practice, and in all their Apologies they declared their utter <hi>Abhorrence</hi> thereof: ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in the Age next to the Apoſtles: then <hi>Tatian;</hi> after him <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi>

would the <hi>Pagans</hi> have given them the <hi>Lye?</hi> What <hi>Hypocrites</hi> would they have been rendred, in pretending that they durſt not taſte of the fleſh and bloud of men (no not of <hi>Cattle</hi> neither) if all the while they were Conſcious to themſelves, and were perſwaded, that they fed daily upon the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible<note place="margin">

And to this purpoſe ſerves that memorable and appoſite Story of the Confeſſion that was made by <hi>Sanctus</hi> and <hi>Blandina</hi> at their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome in the early times of Chriſtianity. The Story is related by <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and (though it be not to be found in thoſe Works of his that are extant, yet) it ſtands upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Comments of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and <hi>Albertinus</hi> and others have taken particular notice of it, becauſe it is a moſt evident Teſtimony in this caſe. <q>The <hi>Greeks</hi> (ſaith this Author) having appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended<note place="margin">Albertin. <hi>de</hi> Euchar. <hi>l.</hi> 2. c. 3.</note> ſome Servants that did belong to the Chriſtian Catechumeni, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

by force to underſtand from them ſome of the ſecrets of the Chriſtians, thoſe Servants had nothing to tell, ſo as to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Tormentors, but this, that they had heard their Maſters ſay, how that the Divine Communion was the Bloud and and Body of Chriſt, they ſuppoſing the meaning to be, that it was properly bloud and fleſh. The <hi>Pagans</hi> upon this taking it for granted, that the Chriſtians celebrated ſuch [barbarous] Myſteries divulged it preſently among the reſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and by tortures compelled <hi>Sanctus</hi> and <hi>Blandina</hi> the Martyrs to confeſs the truth. Hereupon <hi>Blandina</hi> preſently dealt freely with them, and ſaid, How can Chriſtians endure the thoughts of doing this (the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh, and drinking of the bloud of Chriſt) ſeeing that for exerciſe (or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline-ſake) they Refrain from ſeveral ſorts of fleſh, that are Lawful to be eaten?</q> Now ſeveral things are obſervable from this Relation. Firſt, that this ſuggeſtion was originally grounded upon <hi>Hear-ſay.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that theſe Servants did belong to ſuch Chriſtians as were meer <hi>Novices</hi> in the faith, Candidates as yet for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed well in the nature and meaning of this <hi>other</hi> Sacrament. Thirdly, that they did utterly <hi>miſtake</hi> too the ſenſe of their Maſters, and perhaps were <hi>willing</hi> to tell a fable for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59160:102"/>
their own <hi>Security</hi> ſake. Fourthly, that what the <hi>Pagans</hi> concluded hence was a perfect <hi>Calumny,</hi> and an <hi>Unjuſt</hi> charge againſt the Chriſtian Church. And to make this evident to all the World. Fifthly, the Holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> argue from a cuſtome that many Chriſtians then had, of abſtaining from <hi>ordinary</hi> fleſh-meats, when they were not bound to ſuch abſtinance by any Law of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo that 'twas <hi>impoſſible</hi> for them to conceive, that they did eat of the very Fleſh of their <hi>Saviour</hi> (much leſs that they ſhould be ſo Barbarous, as to drink his <hi>Bloud</hi>) in the Sacrament. This therefore is enough to make it clear, that the old Chriſtians in the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and moſt <hi>Primitive</hi> times did not ſo much as <hi>Dream</hi> of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and 'tis a moſt <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> thing for any man to think otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>2. It is obſervable, that the Ancients were wont to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Lords <hi>Incarnation,</hi> from this known and receiv'd <hi>principle,</hi> becauſe the Bread and the Wine at the Sacrament were <hi>Tokens</hi> and <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> the one of his <hi>Body,</hi> the other of his <hi>Bloud.</hi> Some Hereticks there were of old, who would not own that Chriſt took <hi>indeed</hi> Humane fleſh of the Holy Virgin; nor that he <hi>really</hi> ſuffered, or roſe again; but they taught their Diſciples that all this was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a <hi>Shew</hi> and <hi>Phantaſm.</hi> This Hereſie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59160:102"/>

                  <note place="margin">In Photii Biblioth. cod. 229.</note> called it, that is the <hi>Bread</hi>) which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Faithful, <hi>doth not depart out of its ſenſible Subſtance and Nature, and yet remaines undivided from the Spiritual Grace:</hi> and to clear his meaning fully, he ſhews in the very next words, that the Elements in the Euchariſt are <hi>no more changed, than the water is in Baptiſm,</hi> which Remaineth ſtill water after Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Thus theſe four Great men, S. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> delivered the Senſe of the Catholick Church in their times: and if you add them to the forementioned Fathers who lived in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59160:108"/>
Primitive times before them, it will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt beyond exception, that for above 500 years together after Chriſt, the Chriſtian Doctors did no more believe the <hi>Elements</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be Tranſubſtantiated into Chriſt's <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> than they did believe the <hi>Manhood</hi> of Chriſt <hi>himſelf</hi> to be Tranſubſtantiated into his <hi>God-head,</hi> or his <hi>God-head</hi> to be <hi>aboliſht</hi> and turned into his <hi>Humanity.</hi>

               <p>Now the ſenſe of Chriſtians in <hi>thoſe</hi> ages ought to ſatisfie the minds of Chriſtians in theſe: for certainly the faith of Chriſt was never more <hi>clearly,</hi> more <hi>Learnedly,</hi> more <hi>ſolidly</hi> maintained, than in the firſt <hi>five</hi> Centuries; and one reaſon of it (as I conceive) was this, becauſe <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> of all ſorts were then ſo very <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>Numerous;</hi> the Providence of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it ſo to be, that the zeal of good men might be <hi>exerciſed</hi> continually, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it came to paſs that the Doctors of the Church were induſtrious and learned, and the true faith was throughly <hi>ſifted</hi> and <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht:</hi> for ſo it is ever, that as evil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the <hi>State</hi> are the occaſion of good <hi>Laws;</hi> ſo evil <hi>Doctrines</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> are the occaſion of Sound and Excellent <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not wonder, if in the following ages we have not ſuch great Plenty of witneſſes
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59160:109"/>
to appeal to. They were times wherein learning did much <hi>Decay,</hi> and mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and zeal were much <hi>abated</hi> for <hi>want</hi> of thoſe Incentives which had formerly been, like goads in the ſides of the holy Fathers; and I remember what <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> ſaid of the times he lived in, that <hi>whereas Golden Prieſts were formerly forced to uſe wooden Chalices,</hi> Then <hi>wooden Prieſts did uſe Chalices of Gold.</hi>

               <p>And yet we may well be Aſtoniſht at their Monſtrous confidence, who tell us, that Tranſubſtantiation was believed in thoſe <hi>declining</hi> times.

               <p>The Learned Arch Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> hath drawn up the ſenſe of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> into this ſum, <q>that the Bread and Wine are not ſo changed into the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, that they be made one Nature, but they remain ſtill diſtinct in Nature, ſo that the Bread in it ſelf is not his fleſh, nor the Wine his blood, but unto them that worthily eat and drink the bread and Wine, to them the bread and Wine be his fleſh and blood, that is to ſay, by things natural, and which they be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed unto, they be exalted unto things above Nature: For the Sacramental bread
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59160:110"/>
and Wine are not bare and naked figures, but ſo Pithy and effectuous, that whoſoever worthily eateth them, eateth ſpiritually Chriſts fleſh and blood. Wherefore (ſaith the Holy Martyr) they that gather out of <hi>Damaſcen;</hi> either the natural preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacraments of bread and Wine, or the Adoration of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible Sacrament, or that after Conſecration there remaineth no bread nor Wine, nor other ſubſtance but only the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body and Blood of Chriſt; either they underſtand not <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> or elſe of wilful frowardneſs they will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him; which rather ſeemeth to be true by ſuch collections as they have unjuſtly gathered and noted out of him. For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> ſaith plainly, that as a burning coal is not wood <hi>only,</hi> but fire and wood joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, ſo the bread of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not bread <hi>only,</hi> but bread joyned to the Divinity.</q> He that deſires further ſatisfaction as to this, may peruſe the whole vindication of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> in the third book of the Arch-Biſhops defence. This I ſhall preſume to ſay, that Church Writers about <hi>Damaſcens</hi> time, and <hi>Damaſcen</hi> himſelf ſpake for the moſt part as other of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did: They ſpake to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and in many places (to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) very clearly and very agreeably
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59160:110"/>
to the ſenſe of our own Church, <hi>viz.</hi> of the real preſence of Chriſts <hi>Spiritual</hi> body, (which in the next diſcourſes I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to explain) tho poſſibly here and there we may light upon ſome <hi>few</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which may ſeem ſomewhat harſh to ſuch as do not rightly <hi>underſtand</hi> the Catholick Faith in this particular point.</p>

And herein the Jeſuite is followed by ſome Divines of our own, who have taken the inſinuation from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at the ſecond hand; and have thence concluded, that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation had its riſe at that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that thereby the Practice of Image-Worſhip might be the better ſettled and ſupported. But this is falſe; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether this error proceeds from inadvertency, or from a willingneſs ſome have to diſgrace the Catholick Church, as if it had been guilty of ſuch a foul miſtake in thoſe ancient times.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59160:111"/>
why muſt this be meant of Chriſts <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Body? Why might they not intend his <hi>Spiritual</hi> body, and his real, <hi>Spiritual</hi> preſence (of which anon?) Do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>occaſion</hi> of this their aſſertion, and the thing will evidently appear. The Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were againſt the bringing of Images into Churches, for this reaſon among many others, becauſe Chriſt left no <hi>Image</hi> of himſelf but the Sacrament. At this expreſſion the Nicene Council af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took pet, and would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch Language, that the materials of the Sacrament are the <hi>Images</hi> of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood; for they ſuppoſed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be, that they are <hi>bare Images na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> and <hi>empty</hi> Figures, <hi>without</hi> the preſence of Chriſts body and blood; and this they exploded as unſound, and uncatholick Doctrine. Here was the quarrel as to that point: For whereas the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council had ſaid, that the Euchariſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Divine body, the Nicene Council accuſed them for <hi>contradicting</hi> themſelves; for (ſaid they) <hi>if it be the Image of a Body, it cannot be a Divine Body too.</hi> They denied the Sacrament to be a <hi>bare Image;</hi> they affirmed it to be, not ſo much an <hi>Image</hi> as the very <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, and that ſo it ought to be called; but that they hold a <hi>corporal</hi> preſence of Chriſts

and Wine (for ſo he call the Elements<note place="margin">In 1.

               <p>They that had the management of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Index were ſomewhat more modeſt, for they profeſt they would uſe all arts to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, and excuſe <hi>Bertrams</hi> errors, and to put ſome convenient ſenſe to them, or by ſome device or other tell a lye for him;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59160:113"/>
and they were content that his Book ſhould be mutilated, and ſome things purged and taken away from it: this, I ſay, was more modeſt uſage, then what poor <hi>Beriram</hi> received at the hands of the <hi>Other</hi> Cenſors; and yet this was very diſhoneſt too; and a plain Sign of a very <hi>weak</hi> cauſe that needed ſuch diſingenuous Artifices.

               <p>Tis true, <hi>Paſchaſius Rabertus,</hi> who lived at the ſame time, differed much in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from theſe great men, though it be hard to tell what his opinion was, ſo very Inconſiſtent was the man with himſelf; as it uſually happens to Heady Opiniators, eſpecially when they are on the wrong ſide, and will be venturing upon new diſcoveries.

               <p>In the mean time I deſire the Reader to note once for all, that the Romaniſts to ſupport their new Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation have groſly abuſed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers of the Church, by rendring the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Species,</hi> as if they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified no more then <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>appearance:</hi> And this they call the <hi>accidents</hi> of the Bread and Wine, which they grant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, but without the Natural <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>eſſence</hi> of them; ſo that mens ſenſes are <hi>couſened</hi> as to the things which they ſee. Whereas the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> among the Greeks ſignifieth not the <hi>appearance</hi> or <hi>ſhew,</hi> but the <hi>ſort</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of a thing; and when it relates to things of <hi>matter</hi> (as Bread and Wine) it ſignifies the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:59160:114"/>
of thoſe things. And thus the words <hi>form, likeneſs,</hi> and <hi>faſhion,</hi> are uſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, in the ſecond of <hi>Philippians</hi> at the ſeventh Verſe; where ſpeaking of our Saviour, he ſaith, that he took upon him the <hi>form</hi> of a Servant,<note place="margin">

hatreed and deteſtation of this foul Error, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others, preſently fell into another extreme, as foul as that (as uſually men do when they are in Heat and Paſſion.) Then the Doctrine, not ſo much of Chriſts real, as of his corporal preſence was laid upon the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and <hi>Lanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franck</hi> and <hi>Guitmund (Berengarius</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)<note place="margin">See the Confeſſion which was extorted from <hi>Beren. garius at Rome,</hi> and which he afterwards retracted, in <hi>Gratian de Conſec. diſt.</hi> 2. c. 24.</note> fell a hammering at it; and then they would not be ſatisfyed with this (which yet had ſatisfied Chriſtians for above a thouſand years) that Chriſts Divine Body is verily communicated after a Spiritual manner to the faithful. But they would needs have it, that his Natural Body is actually eaten with mens mouths, and handled with their hands. However, this was the ſenſe but of a few men as yet, and all men were yet at liberty to opine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, as long as they did it <hi>Modeſtly.</hi> For <hi>Fulbertus</hi> was againſt the new opinion; and at the ſecond Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Anno</hi> 1079, they did declare, that there was great <hi>variety</hi> of opinions about the Body<note place="margin">Habitus eſt Sermo de Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri, multis haec, nonnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis alia ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientibus.</note> and Bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, as may be ſeen in the Acts of that Synod; and <hi>Adelmannus</hi> though he blamed <hi>Berengarius,</hi> yet was he againſt <hi>Lancfranck,</hi> not owning that Conceit of Chriſts <hi>Corporal</hi> preſence. <hi>Lancfranck</hi> maintain'd it here in <hi>England</hi> (and

               <argument>
                  <p>That though there be no Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, yet Chriſts Body is really in the Sacrament.

And that it is received in and by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO proceed, though there be no grounds in the World for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Tranſubſtantiation, yet we muſt not conceive that Chriſt is not <hi>verily, really,</hi> and of a <hi>truth</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; he may be <hi>really</hi> preſent, though there be no reaſon to believe, that he is preſent after a <hi>Corporal</hi> manner. For two <hi>different</hi> Subſtances and Natures may be joyned and go together, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>diſtinct</hi> in themſelves, and in their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59160:117"/>
                  <hi>properties;</hi> as the Soul and Fleſh of a man are united in the ſame <hi>Perſon;</hi> and as the Humanity and Divinity of Chriſt were united together in the ſame <hi>Lord.</hi> Though we ſhould ſuppoſe that <hi>Pillar</hi> to have been a real cloud which went before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet it will not follow that God was not <hi>in</hi> it, though we ſhoiuld ſuppoſe thoſe <hi>ſhapes,</hi> to have been true Bodies, wherein the Spirits of God were wont to appear to the old Patriarchs, yet this doth not argue, that Angelical Subſtances were not preſent in them, though we ſhould ſuppoſe that to have been a real <hi>Dove</hi> which lighted on our Saviour, and that to have been <hi>real Fire,</hi> which ſate upon his Apoſtles, yet this will not argue but that the Holy Ghoſt was in <hi>both.</hi> In like manner, though we grant the Elements in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be Subſtantially and really <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> yet it will not follow by any means that Chriſt is not <hi>preſent</hi> in the Sacrament: it is eaſy to conceive it <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for it to be Bread <hi>ſtill</hi> and Chriſts Body <hi>too,</hi> and to be wine <hi>ſtill,</hi> and Chriſts Bloud <hi>too:</hi> There may be an <hi>union</hi> of theſe two things, though we do not ſuppoſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>one</hi> to be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> or turned into the nature of the other.</p>
               <p>And that this is not only <hi>poſſible,</hi> but is certainly ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> the Scripture doth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59160:118"/>
ſtrongly oblige us to believe. For, 1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the adminiſtration of the Sacrament is <hi>the Communion of Chriſts Body and Bloud,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 16. which words are to be underſtood, not <hi>only</hi> of that <hi>foederal</hi>

Chryſoſtom</hi> affirms, which doth plainly argue the <hi>real</hi> preſence and communication of his Body and Bloud. 2. Again whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I <hi>Cor.</hi> II. 27. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord;</hi> he doth ſeem manifeſtly to conclude, that Chriſts Body and Bloud is <hi>really</hi> in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, that all <hi>worthy</hi> Communicants do <hi>indeed</hi> receive Chriſts <hi>very</hi> Body and Bloud by receiving the <hi>Elements,</hi> and that Chriſts Body and Bloud are verily <hi>tendred</hi> and <hi>offer'd</hi> even to the <hi>unworthy,</hi> though they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59160:118"/>
receive them <hi>not.</hi> For were it not thus, I would gladly underſtand how it cometh to paſs, that unworthy receiving brings upon a mans Soul ſome <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Guilt? If it be a <hi>ſpecial</hi> ſin (as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words argues it to be) againſt the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of our Lord, it muſt follow that the Body and Bloud of our Lord are <hi>there.</hi> For a ſin is of a <hi>peculiar</hi> nature and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it is acted againſt an Object that is more peculiarly <hi>Intereſted</hi> and <hi>Concern'd;</hi> ſo the ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſeems <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>and properly,</hi> to be a malicious <hi>reſiſting</hi> and <hi>reproaching</hi> of the Truth, in ſpight of thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> which are wrought by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Truth. A man is then ſaid to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly guilty of the ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe in the working of Miracles the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is concern'd and intereſted after a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner.</hi> To this purpoſe it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that when our Saviour ſpoke of <hi>this</hi> ſin, it was after ſome <hi>Miracle</hi> that he had done, and by occaſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching it, as if it had been done, not by the Power and Spirit of God, but by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> It was <hi>eſpecially</hi> a ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe in the Miracle the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was ſpecially concern'd. Even ſo <hi>here</hi> unworthy receiving makes a man guilty of a ſin againſt our Lords <hi>Body</hi> and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59160:119"/>
                  <hi>Bloud,</hi> becauſe his Body and Bloud are peculiarly <hi>Intereſted</hi> in the Sacrament. Evil men ſtrike at Chriſt then after a moſt <hi>ſinful</hi> ſort, becauſe his Body and Bloud are preſent there after a <hi>ſingular</hi> manner; and therefore doth the ſin bring an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary guilt, becauſe it is the doing <hi>deſpight</hi> to the very <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of Him, who made himſelf an offering for us.</p>
               <p>For theſe and the like reaſons the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church of Chriſt hath in all ages believed a <hi>real preſence</hi> of his Body and Bloud in the Sacrament, nor do I know any one Doctrine of Chriſtianity, which hath come unto us with leſs <hi>Contradiction,</hi> then this came down from the very days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> even to the times of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius.</hi> And ſo true is this, that the Learned know well, that the Ancients grounded their Faith of our <hi>real Union</hi> with Chriſt upon this Principle, becauſe his very Body and Bloud are really communicated to <hi>us</hi> by our receiving the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> As they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved<note place="margin">

               <p>For the <hi>Opening</hi> now of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, I ſhall ſhew theſe Five things. 1. That we are to diſtinguiſh between Chriſts <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body. 2. What is <hi>meant</hi> by his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body. 3. <hi>Why</hi> it is ſo <hi>called.</hi> 4. That Chriſt hath a Spiritual Body indeed. 5. That this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body is received by us in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. We are to diſtinguiſh Chriſts <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> from his <hi>Natural</hi> Body; not as if he had <hi>two</hi> different Bodies, but becauſe that <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Body of his is to be conſidered after a different <hi>manner.</hi> Now this is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> own diſtinction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. <hi>There is a Natural</hi> (or Animal) <hi>Body,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59160:120"/>
and there is a Spiritual Body.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there treats of that Exalted ſtate <hi>our</hi> bodies ſhall be in after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> how they ſhall be delivered from all <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> and ſhall be the everlaſting Temples of the Divine Spirit, and ſhall ſhine with light like the <hi>Stars,</hi> and ſhall be like <hi>Angelical</hi> Subſtances and <hi>Spirits,</hi> in <hi>Compariſon;</hi> and all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> is riſen, and gone before us into heaven, and there remaines in a <hi>Glorious</hi> Body, as 'tis called <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>Now this Body of Chriſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, either in reſpect of its own <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subſtance,</hi> as it conſiſteth of <hi>Fleſh, Bones,</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> and other <hi>Conſtituent</hi> and <hi>Perfective</hi> parts of humane nature; and in this ſenſe no man <hi>can</hi> partake of the Lords Body. Or elſe it may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with reſpect to his <hi>Divinity,</hi> as that is <hi>united</hi> to it, as it is clothed with infinite <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> as it is repleniſht with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and energy of the <hi>God-head,</hi> as it caſteth live <hi>Influences</hi> upon his Church, by virtue of the God-head dwelling in it, and <hi>filleth</hi> all things with Spiritual <hi>rayes</hi> and emanations of his Grace. In this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our Lord is called a <hi>Quickning Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>the firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living ſoul, the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a

               <p>2. This then being manifeſt, that our Saviour hath a <hi>Spiritual</hi> body, of which (and of which alone) we do participate, I am now in the next place to ſhew <hi>what</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59160:122"/>
that ſpiritual Body is. Now by his <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> body we mean, the ſpiritual <hi>virtues</hi> of his glorified Body; thoſe Heavenly ſtreams of Grace which flow from him; thoſe <hi>vital Powers</hi> which we receive into our Boſoms through him; thoſe <hi>Divine operations</hi> which our poor Souls depend upon him for; thoſe Coeleſtial and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>influences,</hi> which are derived to his whole Church from his Throne of Glory. For the right underſtanding of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we muſt conſider. 1. That the Body of Chriſt is filled, not only with the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Graces</hi> of the Holy Spirit, where with he was <hi>anointed above his Brethren,</hi> but filled too even with the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>God head,</hi> ſo that in him all the <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the God-head dwelleth bodily</hi> (that is, <hi>really, ſubſtantially,</hi> and <hi>fully) Col.</hi> 2. 9. 2. We muſt conſider, that <hi>of his fullneſs all we do now receive</hi> plentifully, and <hi>Grace upon Grace,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 16. So that tho Chriſt be in Heaven, above all Principalities and Powers, and there is to remain until the reſtitution of all things, yet is he unto every one of us the <hi>Source</hi> and principle of <hi>Life;</hi> Virtue goeth out of him even <hi>now;</hi> ſtill he imparteth himſelf to us after an ineffable, but effectual manner; and the meaneſt Soul in his Church is no more hid from the <hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59160:122"/>
of his <hi>Grace</hi> than the leaſt Plant in a Garden is hid from the <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Hence it is, that we are ſaid to be made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Becauſe we do partake of thoſe Divine <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Influences,</hi> which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Him,</hi> do <hi>transform</hi> and ſhapen <hi>Us</hi> into his own <hi>likeneſs.</hi> And this is that <hi>anointing</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Ye have an unction from the Holy one;</hi> meaning that plentiful effuſion of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> through the Man Chriſt Jeſus, whereby the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our <hi>Hearts.</hi> For Chriſt himſelf hath received the Spirit without meaſure, and is anointed with the Oyl of gladneſs above his Brethren; but this is like the Oyntment which was upon <hi>Aaron;</hi> it was poured out upon his <hi>Head,</hi> but it ran down even to the skirts of his <hi>cloathing,</hi> and perfumed his whole <hi>Body.</hi> So doth the Spirit of Chriſt deſcend from <hi>Him</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Us</hi> in ſtreams of bliſs and joy, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop of comfort which falleth upon our hearts, is a <hi>diſtillation</hi> from him whom God hath made the head of his Church.</p>
               <p>At preſent I do only <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> (what ſhall be ſhew'd <hi>by</hi> and <hi>by</hi>) that every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian doth derive <hi>Virtues</hi> from the Bleſſed Jeſus, which do <hi>relieve</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> upon our <hi>Souls,</hi> as thoſe Virtues did
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59160:123"/>
upon the <hi>Bodies</hi> of ſuch as were healed and relieved by him in the days of his <hi>Fleſh.</hi> For St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 19. that <hi>there went Virtue out of him,</hi> ſo that he healed them all. And when that poor Woman had been healed of her bloody <hi>iſſue</hi> only by touching our Saviours <hi>Cloathes,</hi> he himſelf ſaid, that <hi>virtue had gone out of him, Mark.</hi> 5. 30. which Story is related by St. <hi>Luke</hi> too, who adds alſo, that Jeſus perceived that <hi>Virtue was gone out of him, Luc.</hi> 8. 46. And if ſuch wonders were wrought by the Virtues of his body in his ſtate of <hi>Servitude</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> we may well believe that he now caſteth upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very member of his Church, more <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> Virtues and influences, ſince his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now is infinitely <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Vivifick</hi> by reaſon that the <hi>Divinity</hi> (which was <hi>hid</hi> in him <hi>before</hi>) abideth in it, in its grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt plenitude.<note place="margin">

               <p>3. Now theſe ſpiritual <hi>Virtues</hi> we receive from Chriſt, are called his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> upon theſe three accounts. 1.

This S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> of all the Ancient Doctors (I know of) hath given the <hi>Fulleſt,</hi> the <hi>Cleareſt,</hi> the moſt <hi>Subſtantial</hi> account of this matter: though what he ſays is very <hi>agreeable</hi> to the ſenſe of the <hi>Reſt;</hi> who by Chriſts <hi>Real Preſence</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59160:124"/>
in the Sacrament underſtood nothing elſe, but the Preſence of thoſe <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi> and <hi>Influences;</hi> which are called his <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Diſtillations</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of his Glorified <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> 
                  <q>For (as a Learned Doctor of our own Church hath confidently affirmed) though the Divine Nature be the <hi>Prime</hi> Fountain of life to<note place="margin">Dr. Jaekt ſon, <hi>vol.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> all, and an inexhauſtible Fountain in it ſelf, yet a Fountain it is, whereof we cannot drink; ſave as it is derived to us through the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature of Chriſt. And, though God the Father doth convey unto us many ineſtimable bleſſings, yet he conveys them only through his <hi>Son;</hi> and not only through him as our <hi>Advocate</hi> or <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> but through him as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> that is, through his <hi>Humanity,</hi> as the <hi>Organ</hi> or <hi>Conduit.</hi>

For the clearing hereof we muſt obſerve our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours diſcourſe which the Jews in the ſixth chapter of S, <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, by occaſion of their ſpeaking of the Miracle of the <hi>Manna;</hi> he told them, that he would give his followers the <hi>true Bread</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> that his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which he would give for the life of the World, ſhould be that <hi>Heavenly Bread;</hi> that his <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſhould be meat <hi>indeed;</hi> and his <hi>Bloud</hi> drink <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;</hi> and that it was neceſſary for every one (who hoped for life) to eat that <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and to drink that <hi>Bloud</hi> of his.

               </p>
               <p>This may be further illuſtrated yet by conſidering what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4. how that our <hi>Fathers in the wilderneſs did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat;</hi> and did all drink the ſame Spiritual <hi>drink</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they had the ſame Spiritual meat and drink with <hi>us.</hi> For they drank of that <hi>Spiritual Rock that went with them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>how</hi> did they eat and drink of Chriſt, but by receiving from him thoſe <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues,</hi> which have all along been the Portion and Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Faithful? For Chriſt was with all Believers under the <hi>Law,</hi> before his manifeſtation in the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> they were continually under his care and Providence their Souls lived by his Divine <hi>Influence,</hi> as their <hi>Bodies</hi> were ſupported with <hi>Manna,</hi> and were refreſht by waters out of the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59160:127"/>
                  <hi>Rock.</hi> Now theſe were <hi>Figures</hi> of good things to come, that when Chriſt the <hi>true</hi> Manna ſhould deſcend from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſhould be ſmitten upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as the <hi>Rock</hi> (which prefigur'd him) was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with <hi>Moſes Rod,</hi> he would ever be life and aliment to thoſe that ſhould believe on his Name, and that that <hi>Body</hi> of his, which was to be ſmitten, as the <hi>Rock</hi> was, ſhould ſend forth ſuch abundant, ſalutary <hi>ſtreams</hi> of <hi>Living</hi> waters, as would Quench the thirſt of every true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this real (but Ineffable) preſence of Chriſts <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> is that, which the Doctors of the Chriſtian Church meant, when they ſpeak with ſuch raviſhment of the Preſence of the Holy Jeſus with us poor mortals in this vale of miſery.

The Anciens conſidered, that the

eating of Chriſt <hi>Natural</hi> Fleſh; and the drinking of his <hi>Natural</hi> Bloud (were the thing <hi>poſſible,</hi> and conſiſtent with <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>) could not be <hi>profitable,</hi> could not be to any purpoſe in compariſon of thoſe <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>operative Virtues,</hi> which flow from Chriſt, and <hi>Quicken</hi> all that are <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>apt</hi> to be quickned: and therefore their meditations ſoared high, they liſted up their own minds to Heaven, inſtead of bringing down Chriſt upon the Earth, they minded and ſpake of the real preſence of his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body only.

us to limit or bound the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> upon the Bodies or Souls which he hath taken into his Protection: there are <hi>Influences of Life</hi> which his Humane Nature doth diſtill from his Heavenly Throne: And the Sacramental Bread is called his Body, and the Sacramental Wine his Bloud, as for other reaſons, ſo eſpecially for this, becauſe the Virtue and Influence of his moſt Bloudy Sacrifice is moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and moſt effectually diſtilled from Heaven unto the worthy Receivers:</q> and many more things he ſaith to the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>By this account we may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand the meaning of the ſixth chapter of S. <hi>John,</hi> which hath ſo puzled many Learned Interpreters; and we may fairly give the reaſon of the Sentence of our Lords, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his Bloud, ye have no life in you.</hi> For the <hi>Principle of life</hi> comes from our Lords <hi>Glorified Humanity;</hi> and unleſs we receive into our Souls the <hi>vital Virtue</hi> which diſtilleth from it, we can be in no other than a dead Condition.</p>

               <p>And here to touch a little upon the Effects of the Ancient <hi>Sacrifical Banquets,</hi> which have been ſpoken of before: It is obſervable, that thoſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> were not things of an <hi>empty</hi> nature to thoſe that communicated thereof, but were attended with the <hi>operation</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> either of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Diabolical</hi> Powers. 1.

we have with that ſacred <hi>Society,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body of Chriſt; the Interpretation is <hi>Impertinent, Idle,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> becauſe that place of Scripture doth plainly ſignifie a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Chriſts <hi>Bloud,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Body;</hi> nay, of that bloud which was <hi>ſhed,</hi> and of that Body which was <hi>given</hi> for us; and this cannot be meant of his Body <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.</hi> Some again are as wide on the other hand; who though they grant a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts very <hi>Body,</hi> yet never the leſs <hi>Deny</hi> the <hi>Reality</hi> of its preſence, which is a meer <hi>Riddle,</hi> and an <hi>unintelligible</hi> notion, for how can we conceive, that we really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſts Body at the Sacrament, if it be not really <hi>there;</hi> to deny him to be <hi>Preſent,</hi> and yet to affirm that we receive him <hi>Spiritually, Myſtically,</hi> and <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi> is nothing elſe but to uſe ſo many dark expreſſions to cover <hi>Non ſenſe;</hi> it being impoſſible to imagine how we can Communicate of that which is <hi>Not:</hi> and 'tis as plain a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to ſay, that we eat of Chriſts Body, and drink of his Bloud, if his Body and Bloud be not <hi>Preſent;</hi> as it is to ſay, that we receive Chriſt, and yet <hi>not</hi> receive him at the ſame <hi>time.</hi> Nor doth it mend the matter to ſay, that we receive Chriſt by <hi>faith.</hi> For if Chriſt be not <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and at our <hi>hand,</hi> I cannot ſee how
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59160:135"/>
all the <hi>faith</hi> in the world can help us to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> him.

Nay, we muſt ſuppoſe the Body and Bloud of our Saviour to be in the Sacrament; or elſe we cannot <hi>Rightly</hi> believe, that we do receive him; for to believe that I receive Chriſt at the Sacrament, when at the ſame time I believe that he is not <hi>Really there,</hi> is a <hi>Lying</hi> faith that contradicteth and confuteth <hi>it ſelf.</hi> Seeing then 'tis reaſonable to believe, that Chriſts Body and Bloud are <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>verily</hi> in the Sacrament, it muſt be granted that they are there, either in reſpect of their <hi>Natural Subſtance,</hi> or in reſpect of their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> (but Real) <hi>Virtues,</hi> and in reſpect of thoſe Divine <hi>Influences,</hi> which are, by means of the Sacrament, derived from the man Chriſt Jeſus.

Thus when St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> intimates, that the <hi>Euchariſt is the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> 'tis clear to me, that he meant Chriſts <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Fleſh, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome expreſly</hi> called it, meaning the <hi>Spiritual Virtue</hi> of his fleſh by reaſon of its Hypoſtatical <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Deity.</hi> When <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaid, that the Euchariſt conſiſteth of <hi>two things,</hi> the <hi>Earthly</hi> and the <hi>Heavenly</hi> thing, 'tis plain that by the <hi>Heavenly</hi> thing he meant (not Chriſts <hi>ſolid, Natural</hi> Body, but) that Heavenly <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> which goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Sacrament. When <hi>Juſtin Martyr compared</hi> the Myſtery of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>

with the Myſtery of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> I cannot doubt but he meant, that, as in the <hi>one</hi> there was a <hi>Perſonal</hi> union between <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſo in the <hi>other</hi> there is a Sacramental Union between <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> when the <hi>Pſeudo Dionyſius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,<note place="margin">De Eccl.

preſence by his Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> and where they ſpeak <hi>intelligibly</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly</hi> of this matter, they ſpeak <hi>plainly</hi> to this purpoſe; intending by the body and bloud of Chriſt, which we receive, neither more nor leſs, then thoſe <hi>efficacious Virtues</hi> which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to his Church from his <hi>glorified Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;</hi> this they call his <hi>Body and Bloud,</hi> eſpecially when they call it, by way of <hi>diſtinction,</hi> the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Body, and the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Bloud of our Bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And this account is the rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us for ſeveral good Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe it makes this great Myſtery very eaſie to be underſtood, ſo that without any ſtraining of our <hi>wits,</hi> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Scripture,</hi> we may readily and clearly conceive how we are ſaid to Communicate of Chriſts Body and Bloud.

               <p>2.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59160:141"/>
times indeed they called the bread, Chriſts <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe it <hi>ſignifies,</hi> and <hi>repreſents</hi> and <hi>exhibits</hi> it; but uſually they called the Elements, the <hi>Types,</hi> the <hi>Antitypes,</hi> the <hi>Figures,</hi> the <hi>Images,</hi> the <hi>Signs</hi> of our Lords Body and Bloud; ſo the Author of the Conſtitutions, <hi>Pſeudo Dionyſius, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Theodoret, Euſebius, Chryſoſtom, Origen, Cyril, Baſil, Macarius, Jerome, Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and divers more: ſo that we may well <hi>laugh</hi> at thoſe who are pleaſed to talk, as if the <hi>Fathers</hi> believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs they <hi>all</hi> with <hi>one</hi> mouth confeſſed the Body of Chriſt to be in the Sacrament; and ſo do we <hi>now,</hi> but in <hi>that</hi> ſenſe which the Ancient <hi>Church</hi> meant, they believed the preſence of Chriſt <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Body, and after a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner, and that is <hi>our</hi> Faith alſo: and <hi>we</hi> cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but the old Catholick <hi>Church</hi> muſt lye under the <hi>Anathema</hi> too.</p>
               <p>3. This account ſerves for ever to break the neck of their pretences, who to defend their new Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and other peſtilent Errors which are built upon it, do ſtifly urge the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>ſtrict</hi> conſtruction of thoſe words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> and <hi>this is my Bloud;</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that it paſſeth the skill of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> to give a <hi>better</hi> Interpretation:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59160:141"/>
whereas <hi>this</hi> account gives ſuch a fair, ſuch an Intelligible, ſuch a Rational, ſuch a <hi>Catholick</hi> explication of the thing, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, if they would conſider it well, may look upon <hi>their</hi> Conſtruction, not only a very <hi>abſurd,</hi> but as a very <hi>needleſs</hi> one too.</p>
               <p>4. This account may ſerve to <hi>reconcile</hi> and make up thoſe differences which are between ſome <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches about this matter. For whereas 'tis granted by us on <hi>all</hi> hands, that the Elements <hi>retain</hi> ſtill their own <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> even after Conſecration; and yet the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches hold, that Chriſts <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> Body is delivered together a long with the Elements; methinks this ſhould not be enough to maintain a breach, if men were <hi>conſiderate</hi> and <hi>candid,</hi> and would not inſiſt too much upon <hi>Phraſes.</hi> For if by Chriſt <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Body be meant (as I believe the <hi>old Lutherans</hi> did mean) the <hi>real</hi> and (as they may be called in ſome<note n="*" place="margin">For the Ancients themſelves uſed the words, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>this</hi> ſenſe; as is well obſerved by the Judicious Author of the <hi>Diallacticon</hi> (commended by <hi>Lavater</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Sacrament.)

This account ſerves to the clear mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral Doctors of our <hi>own;</hi> who are wont to ſay, that Chriſt is <hi>preſent</hi> in the Sacrament, and received <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that <hi>really;</hi> but yet <hi>Spiritually, Myſtically, Sacramentally, Effectually, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> and the like: all which expreſſions (otherwiſe <hi>hard</hi> to be underſtood) are very <hi>Intelligible,</hi> if we do but take this notion along with us, that the <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> which flow from Chriſt, are by the due uſe of this Sacrament, actually, really and effectually <hi>diſpenſed.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Other Bleſſings which we receive by the Sacrament. As the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Spirit. Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Words of Chriſt, and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Confirmation of our Faith. An intimate Union with Chriſt. What that Union is, explained and Proved. Laſtly a Pledge of an Happy Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis then being a <hi>Fixt</hi> principle, that by <hi>means</hi> of the Holy Bread and Wine we do really partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of Chriſts Body and Bloud, divers <hi>other</hi> Bleſſings do neceſſarily follow, which <hi>depend</hi> upon this, as upon the <hi>Prime</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Bleſſing. And, as I have ſhewed already, that <hi>pardon of Sin,</hi> is the effect of our feeding upon Chriſt in a <hi>Myſtical ſence,</hi> ſo I am to ſhew you next, that there are <hi>more</hi> Bleſſings which accrue
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59160:143"/>
to us by our Communicating of Chriſt after that <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner which has been explained <hi>now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the next is this, that hereby we receive ſuch large ſupplies and meaſures of Chriſts <hi>Spirit,</hi> as are ſuitable to our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Our condition by nature is ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we are not <hi>ſufficient of our ſelves, no not to think any thing</hi> (that is good) <hi>as of our ſelves:</hi> therefore unleſs we receive <hi>ſupernatural</hi> aids and aſſiſtances from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is impoſſible for us to make our ſelves <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light: Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> as our Saviour told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. without the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Holy Spirit, 'tis in vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that either we can have our fruit unto Holineſs, or reap in the end everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. For this reaſon he there compares himſelf unto a vine, and us unto the branches, becauſe, as the <hi>branches</hi> cannot bear fruit of <hi>themſelves,</hi> except they abide in the <hi>Vine;</hi> ſo neither can we, except we abide in Chriſt. That ſpiritual aſſiſtance which is derived from Chriſt unto every particular Chriſtian, is like that vital <hi>Sap</hi> which is conveyed from the <hi>Root</hi> unto every particular Twig: And by means of his vital Spirit it is, that we thrive, and grow, and bring forth fruit unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59160:143"/>
Hence Chriſt is called our <hi>Life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the <hi>Authour</hi> of that quickning, Principle whereby we live unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and from Him it is, that the whole Body (of the Church) <hi>by joynts and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred, and being knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2. 19. Now this Heavenly aſſiſtance, this quickning Principle, this Divine Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment is given to every Soul by the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and Gracious Energy of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and by the due celebration of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> the aſſiſtances of the Spirit are the more plentiful, and his Irrigations are the more abundant; a <hi>dew</hi> is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into a <hi>ſhowre,</hi> and every thirſty Communicant is largely refreſht with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations from above, as the parched ground in Summer is refreſht with Rain. This appears two ways: firſt, becauſe (as hath been proved) by this Bleſſed Myſtery, we are made partakers of the <hi>Nature</hi> of Chriſt: and conſequently it muſt be granted, that we partake thereby of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt. For conſidering that the fullneſs of the <hi>Deity</hi> dwelleth in him: conſidering that he hath received the Spirit without meaſure: and conſidering that of his <hi>Fullneſs we receive</hi> by this Ordinance according to our capacities and wants, we muſt conclude, that we receive of his
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59160:144"/>
                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> whatever the <hi>Socinians</hi> affirm to the contrary. Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath put the thing out of doubt, if we will but obſerve his meaning in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. where he ſaith, that by <hi>one Spirit we are all Baptized into one body, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtles deſign there is to perſwade Chriſtians to <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and he uſeth <hi>this</hi> as an argument, becauſe they have all received <hi>one Spirit,</hi> firſt at their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and afterwards at the Lords <hi>Supper;</hi> there they all drink of one Spirit, (or as ſome conceive it ſhould be <hi>read</hi>) they are all drenched<note place="margin">For the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves grant a Redundancy in that Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">

To <hi>drink</hi> the Spirit, and to <hi>drink into</hi> the Spirit, are Phraſes here of the ſame impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: they ſignifie the receiving of the Spirit in a very <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful meaſure;</hi> and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion doth conſtrain us to believe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59160:144"/>
that we receive the Spirit plentifully by drinking of the Sacramental <hi>Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed this muſt not be underſtood ſo, as if the Holy Spirit were <hi>firſt</hi> given us at the Lords Table: For <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of His,</hi> nor is he fit to be a <hi>Communicant.</hi> For every one ought to uſe this Ordinance being well <hi>prepared,</hi> with a lively <hi>Faith</hi> towards God, with ſincere <hi>Repentance</hi> from dead works, and with unfeigned <hi>Charity</hi> to all Mankind (as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter) and theſe virtues are wrought in us by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, who divideth to every man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally as he pleaſeth, and as every one <hi>needs.</hi> The meaning therefore is, that by eating and drinking after a worthy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner great <hi>Additions</hi> are ſtill made to our former ſtock. Here is an <hi>Improvement</hi> of every Talent of Grace, which was put into our hands <hi>before.</hi> Here that Holy ſeed which was ſown in our hearts by Baptiſm, is nouriſht and made very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by freſh Influences from Heaven. For as the Spirit is given us by meaſure, ſo is it given by <hi>degrees</hi> too; and <hi>every</hi> Ordinance of God brings a portion of the Spirit, if our hearts be but ready, and our boſomes be but open to receive it. But at this Ordinance men receive a <hi>double</hi> portion; ſo that to him that hath much,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59160:145"/>
more is given, and<note place="margin">Quotieſcunque bibis, remiſſionem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum accipis, &amp; inebriaris Spiritu. <hi>Sancto Ambroſ. de Sacram. l. 5. c. 3.</hi>
                  </note> he hath more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: and by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duely of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Chalice we are <hi>inebriated</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid (if the Books <hi>de Sacramentis</hi> be his.) And if we may have leave to gueſs at the reaſons why our bleſſed Saviour was pleaſed to continue the uſe of bread and wine at this Myſtery, which he himſelf inſtituted inſtead of the Paſſeover, we may conjecture <hi>this</hi> reaſon to have been one, that they might ſignifie that <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi> of Grace, which he gives us by our worthy eating and drinking of theſe Elements. For bread and wine are the moſt <hi>principal</hi> and moſt <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> ſorts of nutriment; the one ſerves to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> mans heart, the other to make it <hi>glad, Pſ.</hi> 104. 15. Now the deſignation of theſe two things to this Sacred uſe intimates that <hi>plentiful</hi> Aſſiſtance and Recruit which is by this Holy Rite given unto all, who love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity. They have not only ſo much as is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for their <hi>ſupport,</hi> but ſuch a portion of the Spirit too as is productive of <hi>chearfulneſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the ways of Religion. This was eminently verified in the caſe of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians, who had this Myſtery in ſuch great eſteem, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59160:145"/>
were fitted by it for the ſharpeſt afflictions that could be brought upon them. They had not only the tongues, but the <hi>hearts</hi> of Saints, and Religion was not matter of their <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> but of their <hi>practice.</hi> They overcame the World, and were more than Conquerours: their conſtancy was as firm as the Rocks; their Prayers went up daily as the Incenſe; their Zeal was like the fire upon Gods Altar, that went not out; their Charity was as active as the Flames, and as large as the World: their Love of Chriſt was ſo vigorous and fervent, that they ſang in Priſons, and rejoyced in their torments and at the very ſtake; and I cannot ſo well impute the reaſon of this; to any other thing, as to their <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> uſe of this bleſſed <hi>Sacrament.</hi> I am ſure, they <hi>themſelves</hi> believed, that the Holy Ghoſt did both <hi>Sanctify</hi> thoſe things which were to be diſtributed at the Communion, and did alſo enter into the <hi>heart</hi> of every Faithful Receiver. Hence it was, that they thought it the greateſt puniſhment that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them in this world, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> concluding, that they were thereby cut off from all fellowſhip with God. Hence it was, that Penitents were wont to beg the Prayers of good Chriſtians upon their knees at the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59160:146"/>
Church-doors; and were content to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> Penance, that they might have the liberty to go to the Altar of God again. And hence it was too, that on all occaſions, eſpecially in times of <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> or <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> they flocked together in crowds and throngs to the Holy Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was the moſt <hi>certain,</hi> and the moſt <hi>effectual</hi> courſe they could take, to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that they might <hi>perſevere</hi> in well doing, and endure all their conflicts and agonies, as it became the Hearty Diſciples of a crucified Jeſus.</p>
               <p>It being clear therefore, that large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Spirit are given by this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, this <hi>concluſion</hi> will ſerve as a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> to infer <hi>another; viz.</hi> that thoſe Divine <hi>Graces</hi> wherewith our Souls are endued, are hereby increaſed and <hi>ſtrengthned;</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that our <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt is very much <hi>Confirm'd</hi> at, and by this Ordinance. For the Spirit of God is never given to <hi>vain,</hi> or to <hi>mean</hi> purpoſes; but his office is, by kindly and gracious operations, to renew mens minds and to bring their hearts ſtill more and more to ſuch a temper and frame, as is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Laws of the Goſpel. So that our drinking of the Spirit at the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt neceſſary have this effect, that thoſe good things are <hi>eſtabliſht,</hi> which were wrought in us <hi>before,</hi> by the Spirits Energy. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59160:146"/>
is this any more, than what Devout Communicants find to be true by their own experience: their minds are then fixt upon things of Heaven; their ſenſe of Chriſts Love is then ſtrong; their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him are then warm; their hope in him is then lively and comfortable; their Charity to others is then great; and their whole Soul is full of the moſt raviſhing Pleaſures: ſo that were men careful, not to ſtifle or reſiſt the Spirit, but to keep themſelves ſo well diſpoſed <hi>all</hi> their time, as they are when they go from the Lords Table, it would be impoſſible either for their ſalvation to be <hi>inſecure,</hi> or for their minds to be <hi>uneaſie.</hi> And yet <hi>Fauſtus Socinus</hi> will by no means allow our <hi>Faith</hi> to be at all <hi>Confirm'd</hi> by the uſe of the Lords Supper. He looks upon that Holy Rite as a work of our <hi>own</hi> (as he is pleas'd to call it) as an <hi>ordinary thing that we do among one another,</hi> in Commemoration of the Lords Death, but not as a Myſtery whereby we <hi>receive</hi> any <hi>benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> any <hi>advantage</hi> from God. But though the Heretick be ſo admired, as a great man of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> yet he <hi>trifles</hi> altogether, and talks <hi>Impertinently</hi> and Idly upon <hi>this,</hi> as he doth <hi>Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> upon the <hi>Reſt</hi> of his own notions. For why doth not the celebration of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery confirm our <hi>Faith?</hi> Why (ſaith
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59160:147"/>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi>) the diſtribution of the bread and wine cannot do it, becauſe they are mean things, which <hi>teſtifie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nec enim panis ille fractus, &amp; a nobis comeſtus, vinumque in poculum infuſum, &amp; a nobis epotum oftendunt nobis, aut ſuadent, vere Chriſti Corpus pro nobis fractum fuiſſe, <hi>&amp;c. Socin. de uſu S. Caen.</hi>
                  </note> nothing, which ſhew no <hi>reaſons</hi> for our Faith, nor contain any thing that <hi>perſwadeth</hi> us to believe, that Chriſts Body was Broken, or that his Bloud was ſhed for us. Now the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and his followers in this argument, do firſt miſtake the Queſtion: for we do not ſay, that the bare <hi>diſtribution of the Elements</hi> is the thing which ſerveth to help and ſtrengthen our faith, but that this is done by the whole <hi>action:</hi> Now the whole <hi>Action</hi> containeth <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>praiſes,</hi> a rehearſal of the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and a <hi>declaration</hi> of Chriſts Paſſion, as well as a <hi>diviſion</hi> of the <hi>Creatures</hi> of Bread and Wine. <hi>All</hi> theſe things come under the Notion of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and each of them miniſtreth to the confirmation of our <hi>faith</hi> (eſpecially ſince they all <hi>concur</hi> in the ſame Action) becauſe they were <hi>appointed</hi> by Chriſt himſelf to be done in <hi>Commemoration</hi> of his death, and conſequently do <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> and <hi>argue</hi> that he died indeed. 2. So that Secondly, theſe men are <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>deceitful</hi> in this their way of reaſoning, that the Sacrament is no <hi>Proof</hi> of our Lords Paſſion.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59160:147"/>
For 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly, that <hi>as often as we eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, we do ſhew forth the Lords Death,</hi> 1 Cor.<note place="margin">Nec often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt nobis, aut ſuadent, <hi>&amp;c ubi ſupr.</hi>

(which in expreſs terms <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Socinus.</hi>) This is an <hi>outward</hi> Teſtimony for my faith to rely up on. 2. The Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is given (as hath<note place="margin">Nonne ad credendum Evangelio, Spiritus ſancti inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore dono opus eſt? Non <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech.

Conſidering that this Ordinance was inſtituted by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a <hi>memorial</hi> of his death, and that he hath appointed us the uſe of it for <hi>that</hi> reaſon and upon that <hi>account,</hi> this is evidence and proof enough to convince me, that he ſuffered and died of a truth. The Divine <hi>inſtitution</hi> and <hi>command,</hi> together with the <hi>meaning, End,</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of it, this is that which we ought<note place="margin">Quid inſulſius, quam ſi quis ita argumentaretur; nos panem iſtum frangimus &amp; comedimus, idque ut praedicemus, Chriſtum corpus &amp; Sanguinem ſuum pro nobis tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe: Igi ur verum eſt, ita Chriſtum feciſſe? <hi>Socin.</hi> in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. ad ſcriptum de Caena Dom.</hi>
                  </note> particularly and carefully to regard; and then if I argue thus, we eat Bread and drink Wine (by the Divine <hi>appointment</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>) <q>that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Chriſt gave his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59160:148"/>
Body and blood for us; and therefore it is very true, that Chriſt did ſo;</q> this is no <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> argumentation (as that wicked <hi>Impoſtor</hi> had the confidence to ſay,) it is rather a very <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> way of reaſoning; for why ſhould I believe, that Chriſt would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to commemorate that which is an untruth. It is a plain argument that Chriſt <hi>did</hi> dye, becauſe he hath required us to Celebrate this Myſtery in <hi>memory</hi> of his Paſſion; and conſequently it is true, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of this myſtery is for the <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of our faith. The <hi>meaning</hi> and <hi>ſignification</hi> of this Myſtery is the thing which we are principally to conſider; and to illuſtrate this matter briefly by two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar inſtances, let us conſider that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Phaenomenon</hi> in the air which we call the <hi>Rainbow:</hi> If you ask a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it he will tell you, that tis nothing but a <hi>Meteor,</hi> the Natural effect of ſuch and ſuch Natural cauſes; but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will tell you, that it is a <hi>Token</hi> of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God made of old unto <hi>Noah,</hi> and therefore when we ſee the <hi>Rainbow</hi> we may aſſuredly <hi>believe,</hi> that tho the World was once drowned with a Flood it ſhall never be deſtroyed by Waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Thus the <hi>ſignification</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of that thing is for the Confirmation of our Faith, tho' there be not groundse nough
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59160:148"/>
for this perſwaſion from the Nature of the thing it ſelf. 2. Again; let us conſider that ancient Myſtery, the <hi>Paſſeover Supper;</hi> the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Lamb with bitter Herbs, to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Pagan</hi> might ſeem but an <hi>Ordinary</hi> meal, or perhaps a <hi>ſilly,</hi> becauſe <hi>unpleaſant</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but to the <hi>Jews</hi> it was a Rite of great <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> becauſe it was a memorial of Gods Mercy to their Fathers, in delivering them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded even their Poſterity to keep it with all diligence and ſolemnity. Now let me ask the Socinian; was not this memorial thus inſtituted, thus appointed, ſufficient <hi>grounds</hi> for all the Jews in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to <hi>believe;</hi> that the Hiſtory of that deliverance was <hi>true.</hi> Nay, are not all the Jews in the World <hi>now,</hi> by eating of bitter <hi>Herbs</hi> only, <hi>certified</hi> and <hi>convinced</hi> and <hi>confirm'd</hi> in their Faith touching the <hi>truth</hi> of that deliverance? It cannot be denied: but that <hi>ſtory</hi> was made undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>credible</hi> by that <hi>Myſtery,</hi> becauſe that Myſtery was inſtituted and appointed by God himſelf upon that <hi>occaſion;</hi> ſo that from that rite any man might conclude; that the matter of Fact to which it did relate, was beyond all controverſie true. Why, this Chriſtian Rite is of the like ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and uſe to <hi>us,</hi> as the Paſchal Solemnity was to <hi>them.</hi> Though to <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>

and <hi>Hereticks</hi> it may ſeem a thing of a very <hi>mean</hi> Nature, yet conſidering, the <hi>reaſon</hi> of its inſtitution and deſignation, it ſerveth very much to comfort the <hi>Hearts</hi> and to ſtrengthen the <hi>Faith</hi> of ſuch as look into it well. For it is the <hi>memorial</hi> of our ſpiritual deliverance by that Holy Lamb of God <hi>which took away the Sins of the World;</hi> and becauſe we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>him,</hi> who is the <hi>way, the truth, and the Life,</hi> to Celebrate this memorial to that <hi>End,</hi> and under that <hi>Notion,</hi> we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the thing, whereof it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, was moſt certainly <hi>True;</hi> we are hereby <hi>certified,</hi> that Chriſt our Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Sacrificed for our ſins <hi>indeed;</hi> and ſo our Faith is <hi>Confirmed</hi> (by this Myſtery) that with Chriſt there is <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Redemption</hi> for us all, if we will but quit our bondage, and accept of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance which he hath purchaſed for us by the effuſion of his moſt ſacred blood.</p>
               <p>Our Souls being thus eſtabliſht by a well grounded <hi>Faith,</hi> another invaluable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing accrues unto us ſtill: For hereby we are cloſely, and (if we our ſelves do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the band) inſeparably <hi>United</hi> to the Lover and Redeemer of our Souls; the ſame Holy Spirit which ſtrengthens our <hi>Faith,</hi> making us alſo partakers of <hi>Chriſts Nature, ſo that we dwell in him, and he in

                  <note place="margin">Exhortat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> as our Church teacheth. I confeſs this is an abſtruce ſpeculation, and that which many Divines have laboured hard to open to our underſtanding, though all of them, have not laboured with equal <hi>ſucceſs.</hi> Some call it a <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>Myſtical</hi> Union that is between Chriſt, and every true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and in ſome ſenſe they call it rightly ſo, for this <hi>perſonal</hi> Union (as ſome fanciful Men talk of it) is ſuch a <hi>Myſtical</hi> buſineſs indeed, that it is an unaccountable and <hi>unintelligible</hi> Notion. Others calls it (and with more Reaſon and clearneſs) a <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Union; and I wiſh that ſome in this Age were not ſo peeviſh as to be angry at every word that comes not out of their own <hi>Mint,</hi> nor clinks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own <hi>fancy;</hi> but would be ſo charitable and Candid, as to give one another grains of allowance, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the unavoidable weakneſſes of our Nature, for many times 'tis hard for us to <hi>Conceive</hi> of things rightly, and ſometimes 'tis much harder for us to <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> our Conceptions. Now for the due underſtanding of this matter, I conceive that there is a <hi>four-fold Union,</hi> which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth moſt to our preſent buſineſs. 1. Such an Union as is between the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a Fabrick, and the <hi>ſuperſtructure,</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:59160:150"/>
which are made one Houſe by being faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with the ſame <hi>pins</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. Such as is between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> who become one Fleſh, by being knit together by the ſame <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> 3. Such as is between a <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> who become one Society by being linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſame <hi>Laws.</hi> 4. Such as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>root</hi> and the <hi>boughs,</hi> which become one Tree by being nouriſht with the ſame <hi>moiſture;</hi> and between the <hi>head</hi> and the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> which are made one Body by being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with the ſame <hi>Soul.</hi> Now our Union unto Chriſt beareth a Reſemblance and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with all theſe (though it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all) and it increaſeth in <hi>degrees</hi> according as we grow more and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Then are we one with Chriſt, when we heartily <hi>believe</hi> his Doctrines, when we love him, and ſet our <hi>affections</hi> upon him, when we <hi>ſubmit</hi> to his Government, and <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>Laws,</hi> when we put our ſelves out of our own power, and reſign up our ſelves to his command, and when our own wills are entirely <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Conformable</hi> to his. This is that <hi>Moral</hi> Union, whereby we are faſtned to him as to the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>corner Stone</hi> of his Church; whereby we are Joyned to him, as to the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>corner Stone</hi> of his Church; whereby we are Joyned to him, as to the Bridegroom of our ſouls, and whereby we are Related to him, as to our Sovereign <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:59160:150"/>
Upon no other Terms but theſe, will he own us to be <hi>his;</hi> and when men talk after that wilde and Iewd rate, as if Chriſt were all <hi>theirs,</hi> though they be of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian <hi>Temper,</hi> and live in open <hi>Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſtianity, 'tis the ſame thing as if they ſhould ſay, that ſuch may be the <hi>Sons</hi> of God, as are not led by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; which is contrary to what S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
               <p>But yet there ſeems to be <hi>beſides</hi> this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Union, a <hi>Cloſer</hi> Band between Chriſt and his Church, and that which is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Cauſe</hi> of our abundant Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: and this I call (as ſome of the Ancients did) an <hi>Union of Nature.</hi> For as <hi>our</hi> Humane Nature dwelleth in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by means of that <hi>Hypoſtatical Union</hi> of our Fleſh in his <hi>Perſon;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Chriſts</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature dwell in <hi>Us,</hi> by means of a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Union of his Spirit with our <hi>Souls.</hi> The ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> which is in <hi>him,</hi> is Communicated to <hi>Us</hi> alſo; and by Virtue of that <hi>Communication</hi> we are transformed into his <hi>Image,</hi> his Nature is <hi>Graffed</hi> in Ours, ſo that we are of a New Conſtitution and mould; and every Lively Member of his Church, by Participating of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> is of the ſame <hi>mind</hi> with him, of the ſame <hi>Temper,</hi> frame and <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> that is, Holy, Humble, Heavenly-minded, Juſt,

Pure, Good, Charitable, Compaſſionate, Kinde and Obedient, as he himſelf was. To do men of Learning right, they who diſpute about Chriſts being a Political Head, do not at all Deny, but plainly <hi>Own</hi> his being an <hi>Influential</hi> Head too. Nor can any thing be more clear, then that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Influences</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> as every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Book againſt <hi>Owen,</hi> pag. 505.</note> in ones <hi>Body</hi> deriveth Influences from the <hi>Head;</hi> ſo that we are animated with the <hi>Life</hi> of Chriſt; there is (as it were) one and the ſame <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>Him,</hi> and in his <hi>Church;</hi> for he that is <hi>joyned unto the Lord, is One Spirit,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>I am the</hi>

Union with Chriſt being thus explained, it is eaſie to prove now, that this <hi>ſtrict</hi> and moſt bleſſed <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is effected by a due uſe of this Holy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> For ſince we do hereby partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of his Bleſſed <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> and are endued with a plentiful meaſure of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> it neceſſarily and plainly followeth, that we receive ſuch a portion of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as is ſuitable to our Capacities; and ſo, that we are <hi>One with him,</hi> becauſe we receive of <hi>His,</hi> and are enlivened and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> which dwelleth in <hi>him,</hi> and are of <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with him. But beſides, the words of Chriſt himſelf are plain, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in Him.</hi> Perhaps the words are to be underſtood, as if they were to be read <hi>Thus, as</hi> he dwelleth in me, <hi>ſo</hi> I dwell in him; meaning, that as <hi>our</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was United to <hi>his,</hi> when he became <hi>Incarnate,</hi> ſo <hi>his</hi> Nature is United to <hi>Ours,</hi> when we eat his <hi>Fleſh</hi> and drink his <hi>Bloud.</hi> And this we infallibly do, when we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily celebrate this Holy Myſtery. Though
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59160:153"/>
in ſome caſes men may eat his Fleſh and drink his Bloud <hi>Spiritually</hi> and by faith <hi>alone,</hi> without the Sacrament; yet we do it much <hi>more,</hi> and more effectually by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and conſequently we muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be more <hi>nearly United</hi> to him by means of <hi>this</hi> Ordinance, then by any other means whatſoever.

doth make this evident ſufficiently. 1. For, firſt, it is ſure, that by the Sacrament we receive the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt; and ſince the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> is communicated to <hi>Us,</hi> that dwelleth in <hi>Him,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily follow, that it ſhall have the ſame <hi>power</hi> over <hi>our</hi> Fleſh, which it had over <hi>His,</hi> to raiſe it up again at the day appointed. Thus <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſeeing, the Holy Communion is an inſtrument of <hi>Uniting</hi> even our <hi>Bodies</hi> unto him, who is the <hi>Head</hi> over all, ſo that the members of our Bodies are the very members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and we become, as it were, <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, leſs</hi> cannot follow then that our <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be made <hi>Immortal,</hi> as <hi>His</hi> is; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any thing which is <hi>His,</hi> ſhould <hi>periſh</hi> everlaſtingly. To effect ſuch an Union as is between Chriſt and his Church, it is not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> nor <hi>poſſible,</hi> that there ſhould be a <hi>confuſion</hi> or <hi>conjunction</hi> of bodily <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:</hi> It ſufficeth that there is a <hi>Contact of Spiritual Vertue</hi> from the Fleſh of Chriſt. Now this <hi>Vertue</hi> goes along with the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and is received by every faithful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, ſo that it doth affect even his <hi>Body,</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59160:155"/>
Sanctifying and Appropriating it to the Saviour of our Souls and Bodies both, and making <hi>our</hi> whole man <hi>His.</hi> And this <hi>Union</hi> cannot in any wiſe be diſſolved by <hi>Death:</hi> becauſe Death is onely a Separation of the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Body,</hi> ſo that for that time the one loſeth all vital activity from the other; but <hi>neither</hi> of them <hi>doth,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> loſe its Title to Chriſts <hi>Protection;</hi> the Body continueth <hi>ſtill</hi> related unto its Head, as in time of its <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and it remaineth <hi>entire,</hi> and ſo its Right to a glorious Reſurrection through Chriſt, is <hi>indefeiſable.</hi> In this reſpect our Condition is very <hi>like</hi> to the Condition of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> when he <hi>himſelf</hi> was in a ſtate of Death. He dyed, as we do (though to purpoſes infinitely <hi>Great,</hi> and with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unſpeakably <hi>Exceſſive</hi>) his <hi>Spirit</hi> was actually ſever'd from his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> when he gave up the Ghoſt. Nevertheleſs, though his Fleſh had no manner of <hi>vitality</hi> from his Humane <hi>Soul,</hi> being really <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from it, yet it was not ſeparated from the <hi>Deity,</hi> but remained perfectly United to it by a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Conjunction, and by reaſon of that <hi>Conjunction</hi> it was <hi>reſtored</hi> to life after ſo many hours. In like manner when <hi>we</hi> give up the Ghoſt, the Body par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with the Soul, and during this ſtate hath no manner of <hi>ſenſation</hi> or Motion, having
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59160:156"/>
loſt the <hi>Natural</hi> Principle of Both: but yet it is <hi>not</hi> ſeparated from <hi>Chriſt</hi> though it Corrupteth in the <hi>Grave,</hi> while its <hi>Mate</hi> is in the enjoyment of <hi>Bliſs,</hi> yet it is ſtill <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to its <hi>Lord</hi> by a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Conjunction; and by reaſon of that <hi>Union</hi> it ſhall be <hi>reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited</hi> to the ſoul in Gods good time, that <hi>Both</hi> may have their Partnerſhip in the fruition of an <hi>endleſs</hi> Life. 3. This conſideration, were it duely weighed, would be of very great <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to good men, when they are going out of this world. But there is beſides a <hi>third</hi> thing to be conſidered; <hi>viz.</hi> that as <hi>we</hi> are <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſts</hi> Nature is alſo communicated to <hi>Us</hi> by means of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which doth <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> conclude an Aſſurance of an Happy Reſurrection. This Nature thus commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, is as it were a <hi>Spark</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Nature, which gives the Body a <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Aptitude</hi> to Riſe again; like that Vital Principle in wheat, that makes it <hi>Apt</hi> to ſpring out of the earth again, when 'tis committed to the ground, though it hath been laid up a long time in the <hi>Granary.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> calls Chriſts<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues turn to the advantage of that <hi>Body</hi> as well as of the ſoul, by reaſon that our Fleſh (being Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Fleſh of Chriſt by the <hi>Spirit</hi>) is by the Euchariſt <hi>Prepared</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſed</hi> for, and made <hi>capable of</hi> the gift of God, which is <hi>eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (to conclude this point) beſides theſe arguments drawn from the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the thing it ſelf, and from the ſenſe and ſuffrage of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> our Saviours own words are abundantly demonſtrative of this matter, in S. <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. <hi>The bread of God is be, with cometh down from heaven, and giveth Life unto the world: I am that bread of Life.—Your fathers did eat manna in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and are dead: this is the bread which cometh down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not dye</hi> (for ever.) <hi>I am the Living bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall Live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my Fleſh, which I will give for the Life of the world.—Who ſo eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my bloud hath eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day; for

my Fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed.—As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi>

               <p>Theſe words are ſo plain, that they need no Explication, if by eating the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Meat,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> here ſpoken of we underſtand (not of <hi>Believing</hi> the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, as ſome moſt <hi>Abſurdly</hi> imagine; <hi>nor</hi> of eating the very <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Chriſts Body, as others moſt <hi>Ridiculouſly</hi> conceive; but) our partaking and communicating of the <hi>Virtues</hi> of his Fleſh and Bloud; which is the genuine and Catholick conſtruction.

               <p>I Have now done with the <hi>Speculative</hi> or <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of this Subject, having after a plain, Didactical manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and aſſerted the true Catholick Faith concerning this Sacrament: and from the conſideration of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which it brings with it, I ſhall briefly draw theſe following Inferences, and ſo conclude the whole matter.</p>
               <p>1. That we are not to rate this Myſtery according to its <hi>Face</hi> and Outward <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> nor judge of its efficacy and Dignity by the <hi>Elements.</hi> For though our Senſes do infallibly aſſure us, that it is Bread and Wine, yet our Faith ought to aſſure us too, that it is not <hi>Common</hi> bread or <hi>Bare</hi> Wine, but ſomething <hi>more.</hi> By the word and Prayer, and by the Secret (but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual) operation of the Holy Ghoſt, there is, <hi>beſides</hi> the Natural and true Subſtance of the materials, an Addition of <hi>Grace,</hi> which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59160:158"/>
is chrefly und principally to be conſidered by us. And this is that <hi>Change</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Catholick Church ever did believe; meaning not a change of their <hi>Nature,</hi> but of their <hi>Uſe,</hi> of their <hi>Quality,</hi> of their <hi>Condition.</hi> As when we ſay, ſuch a man is turned a Chriſtian; or ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is turned a Miniſter; or ſuch a Fabrick is turned into a Church; our meaning is not, that there is a <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> but an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi>

                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:59160:159"/>
or <hi>Subſtance</hi> is <hi>Deſtroyed,</hi> but that the <hi>Condition</hi> of them is altered, ſo that they are Bread and Wine ſtill, but ſomething <hi>more,</hi> that is, they are now become <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> the vehicles of Grace, the means and Inſtruments, whereby the Spiritual Body and Bloud of Chriſt are conveyed and communicated to us.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, when we go to the Holy Communion, we ſhould think we go (as indeed we do) to an Ordinance of the greateſt Conſideration and Conſequence: we ſhould value it highly for that Divine ſtamp which the Holy Jeſus hath ſet upon it: we ſhould prize it according to the Purport and Ends for which it was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: and we ſhould regard not ſo much the <hi>things</hi> themſelves which we eat and drink, as the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the thing, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Power and Bleſſing of God which doth attend it. Men that do not look into the <hi>Inſide</hi> of this heavenly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but judge according to <hi>Appearance,</hi> are apt to entertain mean and low thoughts of it, becauſe they ſee none but a weak and Sinful man that Miniſtreth, and nothing but the Common Creatures of Bread and Wine that are diſtributed. But when we preſent our ſelves before the Lords Table, we ſhould Lift up our Hearts, and Raiſe our Thoughts <hi>above</hi> thoſe things which are
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59160:159"/>
obvious to the <hi>Senſe;</hi> we ſhould bear in our<note place="margin">Hence that very Ancient Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, extant in <hi>S. Cyprian (de Orat.

Thus it hath been Gods method too, as to his choice of <hi>things:</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59160:160"/>
He hath been wont to uſe the moſt <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> the moſt <hi>Contemptible</hi> means to effect his purpoſes of Grace and Mercy; that he might ſhew the greatneſs of his own <hi>Power,</hi> and convince the world, that nothing is ſo mean, but that it ſhall be ſerviceable and effective of Noble ends, as long as it is the hand of an Almighty Agent. What was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> that it ſhould be the Seal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Righteouſneſs, and a ſure Token of Gods Covenant with him and his whole Iſſue? what was the noiſe of a few <hi>Rams-horns,</hi> that it ſhould tumble down the walls of <hi>Jericho?</hi> or a <hi>Cake</hi> of barly bread, that it ſhould be ſeen to overturn the Tents of the Midianites? or a Braſen <hi>Serpent,</hi> that the ſight of it ſhould cure the wounds of the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> or a little lump of <hi>Figs,</hi> that it ſhould preſently heal <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah?</hi> what was a <hi>manger,</hi> that it ſhould be the Cradle of the Lord of Glory? or a <hi>Croſs,</hi> that it ſhould be the Altar for the great Propitiatory Sacrifice to be offered up upon it? what was St. <hi>Peters</hi> Shadow, that it ſhould reſtore the ſick, and caſt Unclean Spirits out of their Holds and Poſſeſſions? nay, what is a little <hi>Water,</hi> that it ſhould Cleanſe and Sanctifie all our ſouls and make Baptized perſons the Veſſels of Election? And yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. And the operations
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59160:160"/>
of Chriſts Spirit are ſo effectual by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that to every Faithful man it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the inſtrument of Salvation. And why ſhould it be thought a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that God ſhould bleſs the uſe of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> or make it productive of thoſe Spiritual Benefits, which have been afore-mentioned? Our Faith ought not to ſtumble at this: we ſhould not look upon the <hi>Elements,</hi> but upon the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> not take an eſtimate of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance by the Creatures we receive, but by the Divine Benediction that cometh down upon them. For when Chriſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Bread and the Cup, and commanded the uſe of them, he intended that this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſhould <hi>ever</hi> be ſucceſsful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to every Soul that ſhould be rightly Diſpoſed. 'Tis S. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> obſervation,<note place="margin">S. Chryſ. <hi>ubi. Supr.</hi>
                  </note> that when God bleſſed his Creatures in the beginning, and commanded them to be Fruitful and Multiply, <hi>that word,</hi> though it was given ſo long ago, yet 'tis power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>ſtill,</hi> and will be powerful to the worlds <hi>end:</hi> and by Virtue thereof the leaſt grain of muſtard ſeed groweth up to a great plant. In like manner that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherewith the Son of God bleſſed the bread and Wine at the Inſtitution of this Solemnity, ceaſeth not <hi>now,</hi> but is as effectual as ever; ſo that they are <hi>ſtill</hi> the

Inſtruments of Our growth in Grace, as they were to the <hi>Diſciples</hi> in the beginning: not indeed by any <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſality that is in them, but by the good <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and Bleſſing of God, and by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt. For the workings of the Spirit, though they be Myſterious and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, yet are they certain and True, and at this Heavenly Solemnity the work of the Spirit is done. So that we muſt draw our minds <hi>off</hi> from the things which are below, which are before us, which we ſee and taſte of, and Fix our thoughts upon the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body and Bloud of Chriſt which are, as it were, <hi>wrapped</hi> up in them; and as the Ancients were wont to admoniſh, we ſhould prepare, not ſo much the <hi>Mouth,</hi> as the <hi>Heart.</hi> And this is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe Rhetorical Expreſſions of ſome of the Fathers (S. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> eſpecially;) where they ſeem to ſpeak as if it were <hi>not</hi> Bread and Wine, but ſomething of a more <hi>Noble</hi> and Excellent nature, that we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of.

                        <hi>Defence</hi> pag. 36.</note> of thoſe Fathers was, to draw our minds upwards to Heaven; that we ſhould not regard ſo much the Bread, the Wine, the Prieſt, and the Natural Body of Chriſt, as we ſhould conſider his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Holy Spirit, given unto us to our Eternal ſalvation: That we ſhould not fix our thoughts and minds upon the things themſelves before us, but lift up our hearts higher, unto Chriſts Spirit and Divinity, without which his Body avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not; as he ſaid himſelf, it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that giveth life; the Fleſh profiteth nothing.</q> The Arch-Biſhop is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious upon this; and I ſhall tranſcribe his words the rather, becauſe the paſſage is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, and the Book is not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <q>This form of ſpeech (ſaith he) is<note place="margin">Negatives by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> commonly uſed, not only in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and among all good Authors, but alſo in all manner of Languages. For when two things be compared together, in the extolling of the more excellent, or abaſing of the more vile, is many times uſed a Negative by <hi>compariſon,</hi> which nevertheleſs is no <hi>pure</hi> Negative, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the reſpect of the more excellent,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59160:162"/>
or the more baſe. As by example. When the people rejecting the Prophet<note place="margin">1 Reg. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Samuel,</hi> deſired to have a King, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God ſaid to <hi>Samuel: They have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thee, but me.</hi> Not meaning by this Negative abſolutely, that they had not rejected <hi>Samuel</hi> (in whoſe place they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have a King) but by that one Negative, by compariſon he underſtood two affirmatives, that is to ſay, that they had rejected <hi>Samuel,</hi> and not him alone, but alſo that they had chiefly rejected God. And when the Prophet <hi>David</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.</note> ſaid in the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>I am a Worm, and not a Man.</hi> By this Negative he denied not utterly, that Chriſt was a man, but (the more vehemently to expreſs the great humiliation of Chriſt) he ſaid, that he was not abaſed only to the Nature of Man, but was brought ſo low, that he might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be called a Worm, than a man. This manner of ſpeech was familiar and uſual to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as when he ſaid: <hi>It is</hi>

                     <hi>wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt he Spirits of Darkneſs.</hi> In all theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and many other like; although they be Negatives, nevertheleſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant not clearly to deny, that he did that evil whereof he ſpake, or utterly to ſay, that he was not ſent to Baptize, (who indeed did Baptize at certain times, and was ſent to do all things that pertained to ſalvation) or that in his office of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Gods word, he uſed no witty perſwaſions, (which indeed he uſed moſt diſcreetly) or that the grafter and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer be nothing, (which be Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made to his ſimilitude, and without whoſe work there ſhould be no increaſe) or to ſay, that he was not alive, (who both lived, and ran thro' all Countries, to ſet forth Gods Glory) or clearly to affirm, that he gloried and rejoyced in no other thing than in Chriſts Croſs; (who rejoyced with all men that were in joy, and ſorrowed with all that were in ſorrow) or to deny utterly, that we wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood, (which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59160:163"/>
ceaſe not daily to wreſtle and War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Enemies, the world, the fleſh and the Devil.) In all theſe ſentences St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as I ſaid) meant not clearly to deny theſe things, which undoubtedly were all true, but he meant, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of other greater things, theſe ſmaller were not much to be eſteemed, but that the greater things, were the chief things to be conſidered. As that ſin committed by his infirmity, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imputed to original ſin, or corruption of Nature, which lay lurking within him, than to his own will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And that although he was ſent to Baptize, yet he was chiefly ſent to preach Gods word. And that although he uſed wiſe and diſcreet perſwaſions therein, yet the ſucceſs thereof came principally of the power of God, and of the working of the Holy Spirit. And that although the Grafter and Waterer of the Garden be ſome things, and do not a little in their Offices, yet it is God chiefly; that giveth the increaſe. And that although he lived in this world, yet his chief life, concerning God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was by Chriſt, whom he had living within him. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he gloried in many other things, yea in his own infirmities, yet his greateſt joy, was in the Redemption by the Croſs
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59160:163"/>
of Chriſt. And that although our ſpirit daily fighteth againſt our fleſh, yet our chief and principal fight is againſt our ghoſtly enemies, the ſubtil and puiſſant wicked Spirits and Devils. The ſame manner of ſpeech, uſed alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, ſaying, <hi>that the apparel</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pet. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>of Women ſhould not be outwardly with broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Hair, and ſetting on of Gold, nor in puting on of gorgious apparel, but that the inward man of the heart, ſhould be without corruption.</hi> In which manner of ſpeech, he intended not utterly to forbid all broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Hair, all gold and coſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, to all Women. (For every one muſt be apparelled according to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtate and degree) but he meant hereby clearly to condemn all pride and exceſs in apparel, and to move all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that they ſhould ſtudy to deck their Souls inwardly with all virtues, and not to be curious, outwardly to deck and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn their bodies with ſumptuous apparel. And our Saviour Chriſt himſelf was full of ſuch manner of ſpeeches. <hi>Gather not</hi>

                     <hi>unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>treaſure upon Earth.</hi> willing us thereby, rather to ſet our minds upon Heavenly treaſure, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endureth, than upon Earthly treaſure which by many ſundry occaſions periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is taken away from us. And yet
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59160:164"/>
worldly treaſure muſt needs be had, and poſſeſſed of ſome men, as the perſon, time, and occaſion doth ſerve. Likewiſe<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> he ſaid: <hi>When you be brought before Kings and Princes, think not what and how you ſhall anſwer.</hi> Not willing us by this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, that we ſhould negligently and unadviſedly anſwer we care not what; but that we ſhould depend of our Heavenly Father, truſting that by his Holy Spirit, he will ſufficiently inſtruct us of anſwer, rather than to truſt of any anſwer to be deviſed by our Wit and ſtudy. And in the ſame manner he ſpake, when he ſaid: <hi>It is not you that ſpeak, but it is the Spirit</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>of God that ſpeaketh within you.</hi> For the Spirit of God is he, that principally put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth godly words into our mouths, and yet nevertheleſs we do ſpeak according to his moving.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59160:164"/>
not preciſely and utterly to deny all the foreſaid things, but in compariſon of them to prefer other things, as to prefer our Father and Lord in Heaven, above any worldly Father, Lord or Maſter in Earth, and his fear above the fear of any Creature, and his word and Goſpel above all worldly peace. Alſo to prefer ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and inward honouring of God in pure heart and mind, above local, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and outward honour, and that Chriſt preferred his Fathers glory above his own. Now foraſmuch as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at length, the Nature and kind of theſe Negative ſpeeches, (which be no pure Negatives, but by compariſon) it is eaſie hereby, to make anſwer to St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome,</hi> who uſed this phraſe of ſpeech moſt of any Author. For his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his foreſaid homily, was not that in the Celebration of the Lords Supper is neither Bread nor Wine, neither Prieſt nor the Body of Chiſt, (which the Papiſts themſelves muſt needs confeſs) but his intent was, to draw our minds upwards to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we ſhould not conſider ſo much the Bread, Wine, Prieſt, and Body of Chriſt, as we ſhould conſider his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Holy Spirit, given unto us to our eternal Salvation. And therefore in the ſame place he uſeth ſo many times theſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59160:165"/>
words, think and think not. Willing us by thoſe words, that we ſhould not fix our thoughts and minds up the bread, Wine, Prieſt, nor Chriſts body: But to lift up our hearts higher unto his Spirit and Divinity, without the which his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy availeth nothing, as he ſaid himſelf. <hi>It is the ſpirit that giveth life, the Fleſh availeth</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joan. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>nothing.</hi>
                  </q> Thus far he. Therefore when you addreſs your ſelves to the Table of the great God, you ſhould be full of <hi>lofty</hi> and Divine apprehenſions of that <hi>hidden</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Celeſtial <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is then to be tendred unto you, how mean ſoever the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of that Grace are in their own Nature. And accordingly you ſhould go with thoſe Holy diſpoſitions and <hi>affections,</hi> with that <hi>Reverence, dread,</hi> and <hi>awe</hi> of God, but withal with that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and <hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> of Devotion, and with thoſe tranſports of <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> as if you were now going to the very gate of Heaven. Men ſhould be afraid to uſe this important and venerable Ordinance with reſpect to <hi>ſecular</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> ends, only to ſatisfie the Laws of <hi>the Realm,</hi> to ſave their <hi>Places,</hi> their <hi>Reputation,</hi> their <hi>mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> It is a moſt fearful act of <hi>preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a deadly and horrid <hi>prophanation,</hi> an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> or <hi>debaucht</hi> minds, when men dare proſtitute a thing of ſuch
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59160:165"/>
a ſacred Nature to their carnal Luſts, and take the Viands of Eternity into their hands and mouths, even when the Devil is in their hearts. When you prepare for this ſolemn occaſion, be in good <hi>earneſt</hi> with God and with your own Souls, be as conſiderate and <hi>ſerious</hi> as if you were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>die,</hi> be as upright in heart as if you were to take the next ſtep to judgment. When you ſee the Holy Table ſpread, call <hi>home</hi> your thoughts, let your minds be as <hi>compoſed,</hi> and your Meditations be as full of <hi>Reverence,</hi> as if you ſaw a <hi>viſion,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the food of Angels let down from Heaven in a <hi>Sheet,</hi> when the happy hour is now come, that God waits to bleſs you with the greateſt Treaſure of his love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grudge not the <hi>going</hi> to his <hi>Table</hi> for it, but bleſs God that you may have it for fetching; and when you go, be as pure in heart, as if your lips were touched with a live Coal from off the Altar, proſtrate your bodies, and caſt your Souls down to the loweſt ſtep of humility, and adore the Almighty like thoſe <hi>Seraphims</hi> in <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who <hi>covered their feet and their Faces with their wings, as they cried one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts the whole Earth is full of his Glory,</hi> Iſa. 6. 2, 3. When the Bread and Wine are made <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and thoſe bleſſed Symbols of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59160:166"/>
Grace are <hi>reached out</hi> unto you, think and know that the Lord of Life and Glory is now coming under your <hi>roof;</hi> and great is the Peace of ſuch as receive him with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate deſires of affectionate Penitents, that bathe his feet with their Tears, and lodge him in the retirements of a clean, innocent and Virgin heart. And when you <hi>depart,</hi> let it be with <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs, and with all the expreſſions of grateful Souls, enflamed with the Love of Jeſus, and with a deep ſenſe of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Felicity, that God hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed thus to viſit you with his goodneſs, that he hath taken you into his Arms; that he hath covered your offences, that he hath fed you with the true Bread of Life from Heaven, that he hath ſhed his love abroad in your hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt which is now given unto you, that he hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to himſelf by the Communication of the Divine Nature, that he hath caſt into you the ſeed of immortality, and given you an earneſt of a bleſſed Reſurrection, and an antepaſt of Heaven; for all theſe bleſſings you receive at the hand of God, as oft as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup of the Lord after a <hi>worthy manner,</hi> and as it becometh Saints.</p>

One great reaſon is, becauſe they have Itching <hi>ears,</hi> but Inſenſate <hi>Hearts,</hi> that neither <hi>Crave</hi> for the Influences of Heaven, nor care to <hi>Receive</hi> them, though they come down in ſtreams God be merciful unto them; but they will one day find, what a crime and Folly they are guilty of, in forſaking thus the mercies of the Croſs, and in trampling under their feet the Bloud of the Son of God after this manner.</p>
               <p>Not that their <hi>imprudence,</hi> or <hi>unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> is their <hi>only</hi> ſin: No there is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>impiety</hi> too, which helps to <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> it. For in this caſe we are not in our own hands, neither are we left to our own <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> The <hi>Command</hi> of Chriſt, whereby we are <hi>obliged</hi> to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize this Myſtery, is as <hi>plain,</hi> and as <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory</hi> a command, as any other in the whole Bible? and if a law from <hi>Heaven</hi> can make <hi>any</hi> thing <hi>neceſſary,</hi> then is <hi>this</hi> ſo. But I will not now meddle with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration:

There being that and many <hi>more,</hi> which relate more immediately to our <hi>practice,</hi> that I ſee will coſt <hi>another</hi> juſt Diſcourſe; as of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> that is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us; and of the neceſſity of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> alſo, together with the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of that preparation which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and divers <hi>other</hi> the like matters, which deſerve to be well conſidered, and to be treated of by <hi>themſelves</hi> in their due order, and by degrees. Here we will <hi>end</hi> this Diſcourſe, beſeeching God to help us to a right underſtanding, and to enable us to keep a good Conſcience in all things, for Chriſt Jeſus his ſake. to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, three Perſons in the Unity of the God-head, be all Glory, and Honour, and Praiſe, for evermore,</p>
               <closer>Amen.</closer>
